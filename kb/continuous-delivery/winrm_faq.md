#### Download artifact for winrm is not working while Nexus if windows machine is behind proxy in CG

#### Create WinRM Credential using terraform.

#### Why am I getting the error "Host information is missing in Command Step"?

```
Invalid argument(s): Host information is missing in Command Step. Please make sure the looping strategy (repeat) is provided.
```

If you are using the Command step, the `Repeat` looping strategy is required. The above error indicates that the Command step was ran without a `Repeat` looping strategy. To fix this, set the `Repeat` looping strategy for the Command step. For more information on the Command step and the supported looping strategies, go to [SSH and WinRM](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/download-and-copy-artifacts-using-the-command-step/#ssh-and-winrm) documentation.
