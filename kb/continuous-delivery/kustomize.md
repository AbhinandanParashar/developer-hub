#### What are the constraints regarding Kustomize build commands within Harness, specifically in terms of supported commands and their functionality ?

Harness supports the Kustomize `build` command only. The Kustomize `build` command builds a kustomization target from a directory or URL.
Please read more on this in the following [Documentation](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/deploy-srv-diff-platforms/kustomize/use-kustomize-for-kubernetes-deployments#limitations-1)
