:::info About Harness Release Notes

- **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means that the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster.

In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
- **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.
