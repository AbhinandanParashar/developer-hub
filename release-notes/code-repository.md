:::info About Harness Release Notes

* **Progressive deployment:** Harness deploys changes to Harness SaaS clusters on a progressive basis. This means that the features described in these release notes may not be immediately available in your cluster. To identify the cluster that hosts your account, go to your **Account Overview** page in Harness. In the new UI, go to **Account Settings**, **Account Details**, **General**, **Account Details**, and then **Platform Service Versions**.
* **Security advisories:** Harness publishes security advisories for every release. Go to the [Harness Trust Center](https://trust.harness.io/?itemUid=c41ff7d5-98e7-4d79-9594-fd8ef93a2838&source=documents_card) to request access to the security advisories.
