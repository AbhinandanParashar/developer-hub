Once youâ€™ve completed the basic setup or installed the Self-Managed Enterprise Edition, the next step is to create your first account. This process begins by setting up the admin account, which will serve as the primary point of access and control for your system. 

## Create your Harness account

You create your Harness account the first time you use Harness Self-Managed Enterprise Edition. You are automatically assigned the Harness user role, **Account Admin**.
