Database DevOps (DB DevOps) enables the definition of database schema migration resources through code to help support you to accelerate software delivery and ensure quality code. 

Harness DB DevOps provides a way to:

 - **Facilitate scalability:** Automating provisioning and configuration management allow databases to scale efficiently in response to increasing loads, ensuring optimal performance and availability. 
 - **Improve collaboration and efficiency:** Integrating databases changes into the DevOps pipeline, team can collaborate more effectively. This helps reduces silos and improve communication, leading to more efficient workflows helping to identify and resolved issues faster.
 - **Increase reliability and stability:** The automation of testing and deployment processes ensures that changes are consistent and less prone to human error. 
 - **Streamline Change Management**: Managing database schema changes becomes more efficient with version control and automated deployments.
 - **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: Automated processes ensure that security policies are consistently applied across all environments, and compliance checks can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
