Harness IaCM Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your workspaces, offering metrics and details that aren't typically exposed elsewhere in the platform. By gathering workspace data and presenting it in an interactive format, the dashboard enables you to gain valuable insights into workspace usage, helping you make informed decisions.

## Use Cases
The IaCM Dashboard is designed to help you:

- Visualize the **count of workspaces** by organization and project.
- List **modules in use** and identify how many workspaces are using them. [Learn more about modules â†’](/docs/infra-as-code-management/modules/overview)
- Create visualizations based on **workspace tags** (e.g., "team:europe") to better understand resource allocation.
