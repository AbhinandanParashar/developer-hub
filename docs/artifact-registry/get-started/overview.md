Harness Artifact Registry is in beta. To enable it, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

## Key Features

Harness Artifact Registry ships with these key features:
- **Upstream Proxies**: Use upstream proxies to easily pull artifacts from other registries like Dockerhub. With upstream proxies, you never need to worry about where your artifacts are just ask for them, and Harness handles the rest. 
- **Cleanup Policies**: Set cleanup policies to maintain your registries and avoid bloat. (Coming Soon)
- **Supported Package Types**: Harness Artifact Registry currently supports Docker and Helm with many more to come. Go to [What's Supported](/docs/artifact-registry/whats-supported) for more information. 
- **STO Integration**: Harness Artifact Registry integrates with our security modules in order to ensure your artifacts are as secure as possible. 

## Benefits of Harness Artifact Registry

Harness Artifact Registry enables DevOps teams to maintain a single source of truth for artifacts (such as packages, images, and libraries) across the organization.

1. **Universal Repository Management**: Store and maintain proxies for all organizational artifacts in a centralized repository.
2. **Accelerated CI Builds and Built-in Governance**: Enhance CI hosted builds, implement governance for deployments, and strengthen your DevSecOps capabilities with integrated CI, CD, STO, and SSCA.
3. **Comprehensive Artifact Lifecycle Management**: Manage artifacts from build to archival with Artifact Insights, powered by metadata intelligence across the Harness Platform.
4. **Global Multi-site Replication**: Enable distributed teams to access artifacts with minimal latency through efficient multi-site replication.
