Harness Artifact Registry is in beta. To enable it, please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

:::

Artifact Registry enables developers to centrally store artifacts and build dependencies. With Artifact Registry, developers can:

- **Centralize and Organize**: Manage all your software artifacts (build outputs, container images, dependencies) in one secure, scalable location.
- **Automate and Accelerate**: Effortlessly integrate artifact management into your CI/CD pipelines, speeding up builds and deployments.
- **Govern and Secure**: Ensure compliance, enforce quality standards, and protect your software supply chain.

## Why do you need an artifact registry?

### Decreased Developer Productivity 

- Slow builds due to long artifact download times from external repositories fetching open source components. 
- Impaired team collaboration without a universal repository manager for storing, searching and sharing artifacts across various repositories. k
- Decreased innovation velocity due to developer toil associated with switching between different tools and repositories for each package type.

### Increased Security Risk

- Increased vulnerability risk and compliance struggles due to inconsistent access controls, lack of centralized security policies and audit trails.

### Increased cost
- High data transfer costs without data proximity of build infrastructure and artifact storage.
- Increased infrastructure costs due to duplication of artifacts across repositories wastes valuable storage space.

## Benefits of Harness Artifact Registry

Harness Artifact Registry enables DevOps teams to maintain a single source of truth for artifacts (such as packages, images, and libraries) across the organization.

1. **Universal Repository Management**: Store and maintain proxies for all organizational artifacts in a centralized repository.
2. **Accelerated CI Builds and Built-in Governance**: Enhance CI hosted builds, implement governance for deployments, and strengthen your DevSecOps capabilities with integrated CI, CD, STO, and SSCA.
3. **Comprehensive Artifact Lifecycle Management**: Manage artifacts from build to archival with Artifact Insights, powered by metadata intelligence across the Harness Platform.
4. **Global Multi-site Replication**: Enable distributed teams to access artifacts with minimal latency through efficient multi-site replication.
