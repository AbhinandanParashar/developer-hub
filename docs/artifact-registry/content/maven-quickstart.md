## Push & Pull Maven Packages

### Authenticate the CLI with the Harness Registry

1. In your Harness Maven Artifact Registry, click **Setup Client**.
2. Copy the provided Maven settings snippet.
3. Add the snippet to your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file to authenticate Maven with the Harness registry.

### Publish a Package to the Registry

1. Configure your project's `pom.xml` to publish to the Harness registry:

```xml
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>harness</id>
    <url>https://<harness-registry-url></url>
  </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

2. Publish the package:

```bash
mvn deploy
```

### Pull a Package from the Registry

1. Configure your project's `pom.xml` to pull from the Harness registry:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>harness</id>
    <url>https://<harness-registry-url></url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. Pull the package:

```bash
mvn install
```
:::info usage
These commands upload or retrieve Maven packages between your local project and the Harness registry.
