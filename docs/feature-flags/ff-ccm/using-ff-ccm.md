Feature Flag with Cloud Cost Msnagement tool is a new feature that will enable you to easily identify cost anomalies when enabling a feature. The Feature Flags module integrates with the Harness Cloud Cost Management (CCM) and is able to correlate flag change events with cost anomalies.
 
From the UI within the Harness Application, you'll be able to report the presence of anomalies which will make it easier for you to find which flags may be related to the reported anomalies.

## Why use the Cloud Cost Management tool within Feature Flags?â€‹

Using Cloud Cost Management within Feature Flags will help you to: 

1. *Increase Visibility*: Prior to this integration, customers had limited visibility into the costs of enabling or modifying features within their applications. This made it challenging for Harness users to identify any cost related cloud costs which was in relations to the Feature Flags tool. Now you're able to gain insights into the cost of your Feature Flags 

2. *Have an Improved Proactive Cost Management Experience*: Rather than relying on reactive approaches to managing the cloud costs specifically to Feature Flags, you can now have real-time insights into the impact of your Feature Flag changes and optimize your cloud spending into a less manual and time-consuming process. 

3. *Adopt Higher Level Troubleshooting*: You'll be able to pinpoint the root cause of any cost ananomalies to any events around your Feature Flag changes. The hope we have at Harness is that this will help you to reduce time to finding solutions around any cost disparaties as well as help to improve your operational effiency of your products.
