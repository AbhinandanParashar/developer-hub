This page describes what Cloud Cost Management is within Harness Feature Flags (FF).

# Cloud Cost Management (CCM)

## What is CCM?

Cloud Cost Management is a solution that provides engineers and DevOps granular detail of their resource consumption hourly. 

# What is a Perspective?

Perspectives allow you to group your resources in ways that are more meaningful to your business needs. It provides a unified view of your cloud cost data across the cloud environment. For example, you can group and filter by Account, Environment, Service, Region, Product, Label, Namespace, Workload, etc. and create a perspective for your business, finance, and engineering teams. Here are some of the examples where you could use Perspectives:

Build your own visual interface using flexible rules and filters. Each role or team within an organization has different needs and criteria to measure and evaluate the business. With Perspectives, business units can create views that align with their business needs based on groups of resources determined by different rules and filters.

Create Perspectives broken down by project, team, department, or business unit to gain granular visibility into all your cloud environments. Perspectives provide a single-pane view of different products, for example, clusters, applications, AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Schedule and share the reports with the key stakeholders for maximum business impact.

Estimate costs consumed by specific teams, groups, departments, BUs, LOBs cost-centers, etc.

## What is an anomaly?

Cost anomaly detection points you to what you should be paying attention to keep your cloud costs under control. Whenever there is a significant increase in your cloud cost, an alert is triggered. This helps to keep track of potential waste and unexpected charges. It also keeps an account of the recurring events (seasonalities) that happen on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

CCM cost anomalies compare the previous cloud cost spends with the current spending to detect cost anomalies. If the actual cost incurred deviates substantially from the expected cost, then it can be a potential cost anomaly.
