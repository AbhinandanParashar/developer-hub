# Tagging Management 

This topic describes the Harness Tagging Management and how to use it with Feature Flags (FF).

The Tagging Feature enables your apps to connect directly to Feature Flag services without having to make a significant number of outbound connections to FF services. The Relay Proxy establishes a connection to the Feature Flags configuration data and relays that connection to clients in an organization's network.

## Why use the Tagging Feature?

The Tagging Feature by Harness is a great way to organise and group your feature flags. You are able to create tags to, not only, categorise your flags, but also to manage permissions.
