sidebar_label: Computing uptime for Harness Modules
---

This is a Harness operational reference guide for all the Service Level Indicators (SLIs) across our modules. Our SLO gets calculated based on these user centric SLIs. 

## Weightage Factor
Harness operations apply a weighting factor to the SLIs post any incidents. 

Major outage = 100% of the downtime hit 
Partial = 30% of the downtime hit
Degraded performance = None  (our stance is that a degraded performance does impact the user experience but itâ€™s not technically downtime)

A production incident, commonly known as an "incident," is an unexpected event or problem that arises within our live production environments, resulting in either complete or partial service disruptions. In the case of a partial incident, it renders one or more functions of a module nonfunctional or inaccessible. All production incidents are posted in our status page (https://status.harness.io) and our users can subscribe to the feeds from this site to get notified. 

## Service Level Indicators specific to Harness Modules

## Pipelines
Pipeline is a core construct of the Harness platform. All of the SLIs defined here will be applicable to CD, CI, STO and for that fact, any other modules where the usage is tied to a pipeline. 

| **Component**                             | **SLI**         | **Threshold**                           | **Availability**|
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Pipeline/Triggers                         | APIs Error rate | More than 1% over 5 min rolling window |Major Outage|
|                                           | API Response Time | 95th percentile: > 1s over 5 min rolling window |Degraded Performance|
| Pipeline Executions failure caused by Harness platform | Failure rate Increase| More than 1% over 5 min rolling window |Partial Outage|
|                                           | Slow Executions | 2x of average latency in a rolling window of 5 mins|Degraded Performance|
| Triggers                                  | Trigger Activations | More than 1% over 5 min rolling window |Degraded Performance|

## Platform
Core platform constructs and services are foundational to Harness modules and any breach of these SLIs will impact all of the Harness modules. 

| **Component**                             | **SLI**         | **Threshold**                           | **Availability**|
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Access Control                         | Permissions Change Processing Time | New permissions (additions/removals) should take effect within 5 minutes  |Degraded Performance|
| Platform resources (All APIs) - Account, Login, Project/Org, Connectors, Secrets, Delegate, Settings, Notifications, Audits, Templates, Services, Environments , Policies, File Store, Log Uploads| API Error rate | More than 1% over 5 min rolling window | Partial Outage |                               
||API Response Time|95th percentile: > 1s over 5 min rolling window|Degraded Performance|
| Notifications                         | Notification Delivery Latency | 99% of notifications are dispatched within 1 minute from the moment they are sent to the notification service |Degraded Performance|
