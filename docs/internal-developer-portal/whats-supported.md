Harness Internal Developer Portal integrations with a number of third party providers to provide a single pane of glass for developers.

## Plugins

Harness IDP supports a number of plugins to integrate the Software Catalog with third party providers. Please find the growing list of [supported plugins](/docs/category/available-plugins). This is a subset of the [Backstage plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins).

## Git Providers

Any software component can be registered in the Catalog by using a YAML file stored in the following Git providers

1. GitHub
2. GitLab
3. Bitbucket
4. Azure Repos

## CI/CD Providers

Harness IDP is agnostic to your CI/CD provider and works with the likes of GitLab, CircleCI and GitHub Actions. You can use Harness CI/CD for a better out-of-the-box experience but it's not required.
