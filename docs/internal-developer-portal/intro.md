# Overview of Harness IDP

:::note
This module is currently available in Beta to limited customers. Contact Harness Support if you would like to try it out.
:::

Harness IDP lets developers **create** new software components in seconds following the company’s best practices. It lets them **manage** their software by presenting a developer-centric view of all the relevant information. And it lets them **explore** the internal software ecosystem of the company, discover tech docs, APIs, services to enable better collaboration.

Fully integrated into the Harness platform, IDP reduces the maintenance overhead and investment required from customers and is enterprise ready with our platform features.

## Service onboarding pipelines

Platform engineers can orchestrate the onboarding of services by creating pipelines in Harness Pipeline Studio. On the other hand, developers can create a backend service, API, or website by submitting a few details. Developers focus on what they do best, which is writing features, while Platform engineers focus on creating software templates, automating processes, and enforcing standards.

## Software catalog

The software catalog is a centralized registry for all your software (services, websites, libraries, data pipelines, and so on), and it helps you track their ownership, metadata, and dependencies. The catalog is built from metadata YAML files, each of which is stored with its its code and owned by a team.

## Extensibility through plugins

Harness IDP includes curated plugins. You can choose the plugins you need based on the tools that you use. The plugins enable you to customize a software component on the basis of its type, and to present all information relevant to developers in a single view. Harness IDP’s plugin library is based on the hundreds of open-source Backstage plugins available in the marketplace.

## Technical documentation

The ability to use the docs-like-code approach enables developers to deliver documentation alongside their software component. As a developer, you write your documentation in Markdown and commit it with your code. Other developers can then find your documentation with little effort. The docs-like-code approach ensures that documentation does not get outdated, and the Docs tab in the software catalog makes it discoverable and accessible by a single click.

## Search

As a developer, you can use the search functionality in Harness IDP to explore your entire software ecosystem and find the services, APIs, libraries, metadata, and documentation you need. When you know who owns the resource you need, you no longer have to rely on rumor-driven development.
