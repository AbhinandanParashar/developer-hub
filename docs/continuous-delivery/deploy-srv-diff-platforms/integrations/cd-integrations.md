# Integrations

Harness supports a wide range of use cases and integrations with other platforms to get the best out of your DevOps Experience.

## Requirements and Planning:

We integrate with Jira, GitLab, Azure DevOps and GitHub for issue tracking and requirements.
- Jira: https://tinyurl.com/v88mmzpp
- GitLab: https://tinyurl.com/bddkypkz
- GitHub: https://tinyurl.com/278p2x3c
- ADO Boards: https://tinyurl.com/45rvzpe2

## UX Design

Harness supports integration with various UX Design tools such as Figma. Customers can also streamline deployments without gates using Feature Flags. Feature Flags grant developers control over feature rollouts with or without UX.

You can use the [shell script step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/shell-script-step.md) in order to integrate with various UX Design tools.

## System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)

Harness supports integration with System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) using Harness Pipelines. For example, the [shell script step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/shell-script-step.md) will support an integration with SCCM.

## Modeling

Harness supports integration with flow modeling tools (LucidChart, Visio etc,) and DB Modeling tools (ER/Studio, Erwin Data Modeler).

These platforms are supported through our native pipeline tools/steps such as the [shell script step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/shell-script-step.md) or the [http step](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/utilities/shell-script-step.md).

## IT Service Management (ITSM)

ServiceNow is the most common ITSM tool, followed closely by Jira by customers who need an ITSM integration or tool.

For ServiceNow, we can:
- Delegate approvals to Service Now as well as create and update tickets using the Harness pipeline. https://tinyurl.com/323ykx7r
- Incidents flow to and from Service Reliability Management: https://tinyurl.com/mtr582tp
Jira also can be used for approvals: https://tinyurl.com/2p82d3wx

## Internal Developer Portal (IDP)
