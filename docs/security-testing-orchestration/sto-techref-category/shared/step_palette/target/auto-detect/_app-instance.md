When auto-detect is enabled for application instances, the step detects these values as follows: 
  - The target is based on the **Instance Domain** and **Path** defined in the step or runtime input, for example `https://qa.jpgr.org:3002/login/us`.
  - The variant is the timestamp when the step scanned the instance.
