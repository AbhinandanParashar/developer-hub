## Set up the pipeline

Do the following:

1. Fork the following repository into your GitHub account: https://github.com/GitHubGoneMad/dvpwa

2. In Harness, do the following:

   1. Select **Pipelines** > **Create a Pipeline**. Enter a name and click **Start**.

   2. Add a **Security Tests** stage and set it up as follows:

      1. Select **Third-party Git provider**.

      2. **Connector** = Your GitHub account connector.

      3. **Repository Name** = dvpwa

   3. In **Infrastructure**, select **Cloud** - **Linux** - **AMD**.

   4. In **Execution**, add a **Bandit** step. 

   5. Set **Fail on Severity** to **Medium**, apply your changes, and save the pipeline.   


## Trigger on a changed file

Now we'll set up a trigger that starts the pipeline automatically when a specific file gets updated.  

### Create the pipeline trigger

1. Select **Pipelines** and add a new GitHub trigger.

2. Set up the trigger as follows:

   1. Configuration

		1. **Connector** = Your GitHub connector.

		2. **Repository Name** = `dvpwa`

		3. **Event** = **Pull Request**

		4. **Actions** â€” Select **Open** and **Reopen**. 

   2. Conditions 

		1. **Changed Files**:
		   
		   1. Operator = **Equals**

		   2. **Matches value** = The file of interest to trigger the scan.

   3. Pipeline Input 

        1. **Build Type** should be set to **Git Pull Request**.

3. Select **Create Trigger**. 

### Add the webhook in GitHub

1. Go to your forked GitHub repo and select **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add Webhook**.

2. Set up the webhook as follows:

   1. **Payload URL** Copy the webhook URL from the trigger in your Harness pipeline

   2. **Cont type** = `application/json`

   3. **Which events would you like to trigger the webhook?**

     1. Select **Let me select individual events** and then select **Pull requests** and **Pull request review comments**. 
     
     2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Make sure **Active** is selected and then update the webhook.  

### Create a pull request and trigger the pipeline

In the GitHub repo, update the file that you specified in the trigger and create a pull request. You should now see a new trigger run in the **Pipeline Executions** page for your pipeline.

The pull request in GitHub now shows the pipeline run as a check for the pull request. Note the name of the status check that appears. You will select it in the following step. 

### Add a GitHub branch rule for the pipeline

The final step is to ensure that a PR cannot be merged if the STO pipeline fails. To do this, you create a branch rule in the repo.

1. Select **Settings** > **Branches** > **Add Rule**.

2. In **Branch name pattern**, add a string or regular expression for the branch or branches you want to protect. For e*xample, you can specify the following regex: `^(main|master)$`.

3. Select **Require a pull request before merging** and **Require Approvals**. This isn't required, but it's good practice.

4. Select **Require status checks to pass before merging**.

5. In the search field below, enter the first characters of the check name and then select the check. 

6. Configure any other settings as appropriate.

7. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Save Changes**.

### Update the file again and create another pull request

Now that you've set up the branch rule, the PR request is locked when the pipeline fails.

1. Go to the scan step in your pipeline and set **Fail on Severity** to **Low**. This will fail the pipeline if any vulnerabilities with severity of Low or higher are detected. This is optional but might be useful to ensure that the scan step fails. 

2. Go back to the protected branch in your repo, edit the specified file, and create a new pull request. 

3. Now, merging is blocked if your scan step detects any vulnerabilities.

4. Optionally, go back and change **Fail on Severity** to a higher level.
