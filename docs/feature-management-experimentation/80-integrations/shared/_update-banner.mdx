:::info[Update for Harness FME coming soon]
**These instructions will soon be updated with the {props.integration} integration setup steps for the Harness FME module.**

Currently the setup instructions apply to Legacy Split (app.split.io). After your migration to Harness, (in app.harness.io) you will not be able to create new integrations for a time. We are working on enabling this feature soon, allowing you to reliably set up the {props.integration} integration from within the Harness FME module.

If you already have a {props.integration} integration set up, be assured that the integration will not need reconfiguring after you are migrated to Harness. The {props.integration} integration will continue to work exactly as before. For more information, go to [Split to Harness Migration Overview](https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/34733129479821-Split-to-Harness-Migration-Overview).

<!--
Currently the setup instructions apply to Legacy Split (app.split.io). After your migration, (in app.harness.io) the Admin API key is replaced by a Harness x-api-key token that has finer granular permissions. Harness API keys are created in Harness under Acccount Settings > Access Control > Service Accounts. Updated detailed instructions for Harness FME will be here soon.
