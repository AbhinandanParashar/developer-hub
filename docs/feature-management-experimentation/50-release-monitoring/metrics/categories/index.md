## Common metrics

This section outlines common metrics and how to create them in Harness FME, empowering you to effectively measure impact and run experiments. You'll find a breakdown of various metrics, including conversions, page views, and more. These metrics are designed to help you build impactful products and drive business growth.

Each section contains information about event tracking, example metric definitions, and helpful links to both Harness FME and external resources. We aim to explain not only how to track these metrics, but also why they matter.

Have a metric or category you'd like to see included? Please let us know!
