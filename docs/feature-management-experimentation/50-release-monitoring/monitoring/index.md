Release Monitoring provides a flexible system to help teams monitor the impact of feature flags and experiments in real time. By configuring automated alerts on key and guardrail metrics, teams can quickly detect regressions, respond to issues, and protect customer experience during rollouts.

With monitoring, you can:

* Detect when a metric crosses a critical threshold
* Automatically trigger notifications based on experiment results
* Respond to issues before they escalate

Release Monitoring alerts are designed to work seamlessly with your existing workflows, ensuring you stay informed and in control during every stage of a release or experiment.
