By the time you complete these steps, you will have:
- **Connected communication channels** like Slack<!--  Microsoft Teams --> and Zoom for incident collaboration.  
- **Set up your team** by inviting users and assigning roles.  
- **Created runbook automations** using both template-based and custom workflows.  
- **Enabled webhooks** to trigger incident creation and response workflows from external tools.  
<!-- - **\*Configured on-call schedules** to ensure coverage for incidents. -->
