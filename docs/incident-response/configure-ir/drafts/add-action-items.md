# Add Action Items

Action items help incident responders track tasks required to resolve an incident efficiently. Some action items may be predefined based on the selected incident type, while others can be added manually during the incident.

If no predefined action items exist, the list will be empty.

Adding action items during an incident does not persist them to the incident type. Administrators can configure predefined action items for specific incident types, ensuring consistency across incidents.
