# Creating New Activity Fields

An **activity field** is a data element within an activity, such as **Severity** or **Hours of Downtime**. Each activity field has a **name** and a **type**, determining how it is displayed and used.

## Understanding Activity Fields

:::tip
Before creating new fields, review the **default activity fields** to determine if they meet your needs. Each new activity type should have at least one or two assigned activity fields.
:::

If additional fields are required, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Activity Fields**.
2. Click **New Activity Field** to create a custom field.
