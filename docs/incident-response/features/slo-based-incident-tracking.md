# SLO-Based Incident Tracking and Planning

Harness Incident Response (**IR**) enables teams to leverage **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** to proactively track incidents and drive operational improvements.

---

## Why Use SLOs for Incident Tracking?

âœ… **Proactive Incident Detection** â€“ Identify issues **before they cause outages**.  
âœ… **Data-Driven Response Planning** â€“ Use **error budgets** to prioritize incident handling.  
âœ… **Align Engineering & Business Goals** â€“ Track **SLIs** to maintain user experience.  
âœ… **Improve Post-Incident Analysis** â€“ Use **historical SLO data** for root cause analysis.

## How SLO-Based Tracking Works

### **1. Defining SLOs and SLIs**
- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** define the **acceptable performance level** for a service.
- **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)** track real-time **latency, availability, and reliability**.
- **Error budgets** help teams **balance feature velocity with reliability**.

### **2. Monitoring & Alerting Based on SLOs**
- IR **tracks SLO breaches** to detect early signs of degradation.
- Use **SLO-based alerting** to trigger **automated remediations**.
- **Example:** If error budget consumption exceeds **80%**, auto-create a **Jira ticket**.

### **3. Automating Work Item Creation Based on SLO Trends**
- If an SLO violation occurs, IR **automatically logs work items** in:
  - **Jira**
  - **ServiceNow**
  - **PagerDuty**
- Engineers receive **actionable insights** on **how incidents impact SLOs**.

## Where SLO-Based Tracking Helps in Incident Response

### **ðŸ“Œ Early Detection of Performance Issues**
- **Example:** API latency exceeds **200ms** â†’ **IR triggers a scaling Runbook**.
- **Example:** Service availability drops **below 99.9%** â†’ **Slack alert is sent**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Automating Incident Response**
- Define **automated actions** when **error budgets are exhausted**.
- IR can **escalate incidents** based on **SLO compliance trends**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Using AI to Predict Future SLO Violations**
- IRâ€™s **AI models analyze past incidents** to predict future SLO breaches.
- Teams can proactively adjust capacity **before outages occur**.

## Example: SLO-Based Ticket Creation Workflow

```yaml
slo_monitor:
  name: API Latency SLO
  threshold: 200ms
  alert:
    - condition: "Latency > 200ms for 5 min"
      action: "create_ticket"
  integration:
    - jira: "Jira_Project"
    - slack: "Slack_Channel"
```
Example Execution Flow
	1.	ðŸ“Š SLO Deviation Detected: API latency crosses 200ms threshold.
	2.	ðŸš¨ Incident Triggered: Error budget consumption exceeds 80%.
	3.	ðŸ“Œ Work Item Created: IR logs a Jira issue with details.
	4.	âœ… Team Notified: Slack notification sent with AI-based resolution steps.

Best Practices for SLO-Based Tracking
-Use historical SLO trends â€“ Identify patterns before incidents happen.
-Tie SLOs to incident response â€“ Automate ticketing when error budgets deplete.
-Integrate monitoring tools â€“ Connect Datadog, Prometheus, New Relic.
-Optimize error budgets â€“ Adjust SLO targets dynamically based on service performance.
