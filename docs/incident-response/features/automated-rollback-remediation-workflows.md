# Automated Rollback & Remediation Workflows

Harness Incident Response (**IR**) enables teams to **automate rollback and remediation workflows**, ensuring **faster incident recovery** and **minimizing service disruption**.

---

## Why Use Automated Rollback & Remediation?

âœ… **Faster Incident Recovery** â€“ Reduces **mean time to resolution (MTTR)**.  
âœ… **Minimized Downtime** â€“ Ensures **services remain stable** by reverting bad deployments.  
âœ… **Predefined Remediation Actions** â€“ Standardizes **response actions for known failures**.  
âœ… **Eliminates Manual Intervention** â€“ Allows teams to **focus on root cause analysis** instead of firefighting.

## How Automated Rollback & Remediation Works in IR

### **1. Incident Detection & Root Cause Analysis**
- IR **detects anomalies, service degradations, and failures**.
- **AI-driven event correlation** identifies the root cause.
- **Example:** A **Kubernetes deployment failure** triggers an **automatic rollback**.

### **2. Triggering Automated Remediation Workflows**
- Based on **predefined conditions**, IR **triggers remediation workflows**.
- **Runbooks execute automated fixes** such as **scaling services, restarting pods, or applying patches**.
- **Example:** If a **database connection error is detected**, IR **triggers a Runbook to restart the affected service**.

### **3. Rollback & Service Restoration**
- IR **reverts failed changes** to the last known **healthy state**.
- Rollbacks can be **triggered manually or automatically** based on failure conditions.
- **Example:** If a **CI/CD deployment results in 500 errors**, IR **automatically rolls back to the previous stable version**.

## Where Automated Rollback & Remediation Helps

### **ðŸ“Œ Rolling Back Failed Deployments**
- Detects **failed deployments** and **reverts them automatically**.
- Works with **Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and other deployment tools**.
- **Example:** If a **new microservice deployment increases error rates**, IR **rolls back to the last stable release**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Auto-Healing Services**
- IR **monitors infrastructure and application health**.
- If a **service degrades, IR automatically applies fixes**.
- **Example:** If a **memory leak is detected**, IR **restarts the affected pods**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Self-Healing Infrastructure**
- IR integrates with **cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)** to **auto-remediate infrastructure failures**.
- **Example:** If an **EC2 instance crashes**, IR **recreates the instance and restores workloads**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Preventing Recurring Failures**
- IR **analyzes past incidents** to **refine rollback strategies**.
- AI-driven learning **improves failure predictions** and **prevents repeat incidents**.

## Example: Automated Rollback Workflow

```yaml
rollback_workflow:
  name: Kubernetes Deployment Rollback
  trigger:
    - condition: "Deployment failure detected"
      action: "trigger_rollback"
  integration:
    - jira: "Jira_Project"
    - slack: "Slack_Channel"
  remediation:
    - type: "rollback"
      target: "last_successful_deployment"
```
Example Execution Flow
	1.	ðŸš¨ Incident Detected: A Kubernetes deployment fails, causing service downtime.
	2.	ðŸ“Œ AI Identifies Root Cause: IR analyzes logs and metrics to determine the failure.
	3.	ðŸ”„ Automated Rollback Triggered: IR reverts to the last stable deployment.
	4.	âœ… Service Restored: Downtime is minimized, and incident resolution is documented automatically.

Best Practices for Automated Rollback & Remediation
-Define rollback conditions â€“ Use SLO breaches, error rates, or anomaly detection as rollback triggers.
-Automate rollback workflows â€“ Ensure Runbooks are pre-configured for rollback actions.
-Integrate with CI/CD pipelines â€“ Automate failure rollback within deployment workflows.
-Enable self-healing â€“ Use AI-driven remediation for faster infrastructure recovery.
