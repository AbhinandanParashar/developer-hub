# Anomaly Detection & Predictive Analysis

Harness Incident Response (**IR**) enables teams to **detect anomalies in real-time** and leverage **predictive analysis** to prevent future incidents before they escalate.

---

## Why Use Anomaly Detection in Incident Response?

âœ… **Early Detection of Service Degradation** â€“ Identify **performance issues before failures occur**.  
âœ… **AI-Driven Predictive Alerts** â€“ Get **proactive alerts** based on historical trends.  
âœ… **Reduced Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)** â€“ Detect issues **before customers notice them**.  
âœ… **Smarter Auto-Remediation** â€“ IR **automates fixes** when anomalies are detected.

## How Anomaly Detection Works in Harness IR

### **1. AI-Powered Pattern Recognition**
- **Machine learning (ML) models** analyze **telemetry data, logs, and metrics**.
- IR detects **outliers, performance deviations, and unusual system behaviors**.
- **Example:** Sudden **increase in latency or CPU spikes** triggers anomaly alerts.

### **2. Predictive Incident Analysis**
- IR **correlates past incidents** to forecast **future failure risks**.
- AI models use **time-series data** to predict when **SLO breaches** may occur.
- **Example:** AI predicts a **90% chance of API failure** due to increasing latency trends.

### **3. Automated Anomaly Response**
- When IR detects an anomaly, it can **automatically trigger remediation actions**.
- Teams can configure **Runbooks** to **scale services, restart pods, or create tickets**.
- **Example:** If **database response time spikes**, IR triggers a **horizontal scaling event**.

## Where Anomaly Detection Helps in IR

### **ðŸ“Œ Real-Time Alerting on Unusual Activity**
- Detects **abnormal CPU, memory, latency, and network traffic spikes**.
- **Example:** **50% increase in error rates within 10 minutes** triggers an alert.
- Reduces **false positives** by **filtering out noise from normal fluctuations**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Predicting and Preventing Major Incidents**
- AI **learns from past outages** to predict **service degradation**.
- Helps **reduce unplanned downtime** and **improve reliability**.
- **Example:** IR predicts that a **backend service will degrade in 6 hours** based on **current trends**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Automating Incident Response Based on Anomaly Trends**
- IR **correlates alerts** with **historical failure patterns**.
- Automates **ticket creation in Jira, ServiceNow, or PagerDuty** when anomalies are detected.
- **Example:** If a **Kubernetes pod restart count spikes**, IR **automatically opens a ServiceNow incident**.

## Example: AI-Driven Anomaly Detection Workflow

```yaml
anomaly_monitor:
  name: High Latency Anomaly Detection
  threshold: "latency > 300ms"
  alert:
    - condition: "Latency > 300ms for 10 min"
      action: "trigger_runbook"
  integration:
    - jira: "Jira_Project"
    - slack: "Slack_Channel"
```
Example Execution Flow
	1.	ðŸ“Š Anomaly Detected: API response latency exceeds 300ms for 10 minutes.
	2.	ðŸš¨ Alert Generated: IR flags this anomaly and triggers a predictive failure warning.
	3.	ðŸ“Œ Incident Created: A Jira ticket is automatically generated for investigation.
	4.	âœ… Automated Mitigation: A Runbook scales up the service to restore normal latency.

Best Practices for Anomaly Detection & Predictive Analysis
-Use AI-driven alerts â€“ Avoid manual threshold configurations.
-Integrate with monitoring tools â€“ Connect Datadog, Prometheus, New Relic, Grafana.
-Fine-tune false positives â€“ Optimize anomaly detection sensitivity for accurate alerts.
-Automate response actions â€“ Trigger Runbooks and rollback workflows when anomalies are detected.
