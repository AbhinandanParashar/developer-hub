# Runbook Automation for Resolution

Harness Incident Response (**IR**) enables teams to automate incident resolution using **Runbooks**, reducing manual intervention and accelerating response times.

---

## Why Use Runbooks for Incident Resolution?

‚úÖ **Reduce Response Time** ‚Äì Automate key resolution steps to fix issues faster.  
‚úÖ **Eliminate Repetitive Tasks** ‚Äì Reduce manual work by automating common remediations.  
‚úÖ **Ensure Consistency** ‚Äì Standardize response workflows across teams.  
‚úÖ **Improve Collaboration** ‚Äì Integrate with communication tools for seamless execution.

## How Runbook Automation Works

### **1. Automating Common Incident Responses**
- Automatically trigger Runbooks **when an incident is detected**.
- Use **predefined workflows** for actions like:
  - **Restarting services**.
  - **Rolling back faulty deployments**.
  - **Scaling infrastructure dynamically**.

### **2. Integrating Runbooks with Monitoring & Alerts**
- Connect Runbooks with **Datadog, Prometheus, and New Relic** to auto-trigger based on alerts.
- Use **SLO-based automation** to trigger responses before SLIs degrade.
- Reduce **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)** with instant remediation.

### **3. Executing Runbooks via ChatOps**
- Runbook actions can be executed from **Slack or Microsoft Teams**.
- AI-powered chat assistants **suggest Runbooks** based on incident context.
- Responders can trigger **pre-configured workflows** with a single command.

## Where Runbook Automation Helps in Incident Response

### **üìå Auto-Triggering Remediation**
- **Example:** If a Kubernetes pod crashes, automatically restart it via a Runbook.
- **Example:** If an API latency spike is detected, rollback the latest deployment.

### **üìå Standardized Playbooks**
- Teams can **codify best practices** into Runbooks for:
  - **Database failovers**.
  - **Infrastructure scaling**.
  - **Cloud service restarts**.

### **üìå AI-Powered Runbook Execution**
- AI suggests **relevant Runbooks** based on historical incident patterns.
- Automated workflows are triggered based on **incident category & severity**.

## Example: Runbook for Restarting a Failed Service

```yaml
runbook:
  name: Restart Service
  description: Automatically restart a failed service if it crashes.
  triggers:
    - condition: "ServiceDown"
      action: "Restart"
  steps:
    - check_status: "service_status.sh"
    - if_failed:
        - action: "restart_service.sh"
    - notify: "Slack_Channel"
```
Example Runbook Execution Flow
	1.	üö® Incident Detected: API service is down.
	2.	üîÑ Runbook Triggered: Service restart workflow is executed.
	3.	‚úÖ Resolution Completed: API is back online.
	4.	üì¢ Slack Notification: ‚ÄúService has been restarted successfully.‚Äù

-Use AI-driven recommendations ‚Äì Let AI suggest relevant Runbooks.
-Integrate Runbooks with alerts ‚Äì Trigger automations based on monitoring insights.
-Leverage ChatOps ‚Äì Enable responders to execute Runbooks via Slack or Teams.
