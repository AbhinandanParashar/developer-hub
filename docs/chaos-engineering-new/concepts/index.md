# Chaos Engineering Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts of chaos engineering is essential for building resilient systems. This section covers the core principles, methodologies, and best practices.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build a Hypothesis Around Steady State Behavior
Define what "normal" looks like for your system before introducing chaos.

### 2. Vary Real-world Events
Simulate realistic failure scenarios that could occur in production.

### 3. Run Experiments in Production
The most valuable insights come from production environments.

### 4. Automate Experiments
Continuous chaos engineering through automation and integration.

### 5. Minimize Blast Radius
Start small and gradually increase the scope of experiments.

## Key Concepts

- **Fault Injection**: Deliberately introducing failures into your system
- **Resilience**: The ability of a system to recover from failures
- **Observability**: Monitoring and measuring system behavior during experiments
- **Blast Radius**: The scope and impact of a chaos experiment
- **Steady State**: The normal operating condition of your system

## Experiment Types

- **Infrastructure Faults**: CPU, memory, network, and disk failures
- **Application Faults**: Service failures, latency injection, and error injection
- **Platform Faults**: Cloud provider and Kubernetes-specific failures

## Best Practices

- Always have a rollback plan
- Start with non-critical systems
- Involve your entire team
- Document everything
- Learn from every experiment
