### 🏢 On-premises (SMP)
Deploy and manage Harness Chaos Engineering in your own infrastructure.

### ⚡ Custom Faults
Create and implement custom chaos faults tailored to your specific use cases.

## Getting Started

If you're new to chaos engineering with Harness, we recommend starting with:

1. **[Chaos Experiments](./chaos-experiments)** - Learn the fundamentals of creating experiments
2. **[Probes & Actions](./probes-actions)** - Understand how to validate system behavior
3. **[Application Maps](./application-maps)** - Visualize your system architecture
4. **[Pipelines](./pipelines)** - Integrate with your existing workflows

## Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with low-impact experiments and gradually increase scope
- **Monitor Continuously**: Use probes and monitoring to track system behavior
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of experiments and outcomes
- **Collaborate**: Involve cross-functional teams in chaos engineering practices
- **Iterate**: Continuously improve your experiments based on learnings
