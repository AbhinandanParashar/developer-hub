# Security Overview

Harness provides comprehensive security controls to ensure the safe execution of chaos experiments on your infrastructure. This section covers security considerations and features across administrative and runtime environments, including authentication, authorization, network security, and blast radius control.

Chaos engineering security operates on multiple layers to protect your infrastructure while enabling effective resilience testing:

### Core Security Principles
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal permissions required for experiment execution
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
- **Secure by Default**: Safe configurations and automatic rollback mechanisms
- **Audit and Compliance**: Complete visibility into chaos activities
- **Blast Radius Control**: Containment of experiment impact

### Security Architecture Components
- **Control Plane Security**: Authentication, authorization, and API security
- **Execution Plane Security**: Isolated experiment execution with RBAC
- **Network Security**: Encrypted communication and network isolation
- **Data Protection**: Secure secrets management and data handling
- **Monitoring & Auditing**: Complete activity logging and compliance reporting

## Connectivity and Authentication

### Secure Infrastructure Connection

Your Kubernetes infrastructure connects to Harness Chaos Engineering through a secure, outbound-only communication model:

**Connection Architecture:**
- **Outbound HTTPS**: Chaos infrastructure makes outbound requests over HTTPS (port 443)
- **No Inbound Rules**: No inbound traffic rules required on your infrastructure
- **Unique Authentication**: Each infrastructure has a unique cluster ID and access key
- **Encrypted Communication**: All data transmission is encrypted in transit

![Security Overview](./static/overview/overview.png)

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Chaos infrastructure generates unique cluster ID and access key during installation
2. All API requests include these identifiers for authentication
3. Control plane validates credentials before processing requests
4. Secure token refresh and rotation mechanisms

### Multi-Environment Support

Harness can leverage the same cluster to inject chaos into various targets:
- **Kubernetes Resources**: Pods, services, deployments within the cluster
- **Infrastructure Targets**: VMs, cloud resources accessible from the cluster
- **External Services**: APIs and services reachable from the execution environment

:::info Cloud Integration

## Kubernetes Security Model

### Service Account Architecture

Chaos infrastructure deployments use dedicated service accounts with carefully scoped permissions:

**Installation Modes:**
- **Cluster-wide Scope**: Full cluster access for comprehensive testing
- **Namespace-only Scope**: Restricted access to specific namespaces
- **Custom Scope**: Fine-tuned permissions for specific use cases

### Permission Management

The default permissions enable comprehensive chaos testing while maintaining security:

**Core Permissions:**
- **Pod Management**: Create, delete, monitor experiment and helper pods
- **Resource Access**: Read deployments, services, and configuration data
- **Event Logging**: Create and update experiment events and results
- **Network Control**: Manage network policies for network chaos

**Advanced Permissions:**
- **Custom Resource Management**: Handle Litmus chaos resources
- **Job Execution**: Create and manage batch jobs for experiments
- **Metric Collection**: Access monitoring data for validation

:::note Permission Tuning
Permissions can be fine-tuned based on your environment and experiment requirements. See [Blast Radius Control](#blast-radius-control) for detailed guidance.
:::

### Namespace Isolation

Implement namespace-level security controls:

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced Blast Radius**: Limit chaos impact to specific namespaces
- **Environment Separation**: Isolate development, staging, and production
- **Team Boundaries**: Align chaos permissions with team responsibilities
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meet regulatory isolation requirements

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Install chaos infrastructure in cluster mode
2. Delete default ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
3. Create namespace-specific Roles and RoleBindings
4. Verify isolation through testing

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- **API Keys**: Programmatic access with proper scoping

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Built-in Roles:**
- **Chaos Engineering Admin**: Full platform administration
- **Chaos Engineering Editor**: Create and manage experiments
- **Chaos Engineering Viewer**: Read-only access to experiments and results
- **Custom Roles**: Tailored permissions for specific needs

**Permission Granularity:**
- **Environment-level**: Control access to specific environments
- **Infrastructure-level**: Manage chaos infrastructure permissions
- **Experiment-level**: Fine-grained experiment execution controls
- **Resource-level**: Specific resource type permissions

### Access Control Best Practices

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Grant minimum permissions required for job functions
- Regular review and cleanup of unused permissions
- Time-bound access for temporary requirements
- Separation of duties for critical operations

**Audit and Monitoring:**
- Complete audit trail of all user actions

## Secrets Management

### Control Plane Secrets

Harness leverages the native Harness Secret Manager for administrative secrets:

**ChaosHub Connectivity:**
- **Git Repository Access**: Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or SSH keys
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage in Harness Secret Manager
- **Scope Management**: Proper permissions for repository operations
- **Rotation Support**: Automated secret rotation capabilities

![Control Plane Secrets](./static/overview/control-plane-secrets.png)

### Runtime Secrets

Experiment execution secrets are managed within your Kubernetes clusters:

**Cloud Provider Access:**
- **AWS Credentials**: IAM roles, access keys, session tokens
- **Azure Credentials**: Service principals, managed identities
- **GCP Credentials**: Service account keys, workload identity
- **Custom Providers**: API keys and authentication tokens

![Experiment Secrets](./static/overview/experiment-secrets.png)

**Secret Management Best Practices:**
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Store sensitive data as Kubernetes secrets
- **Secret References**: Experiments reference secret names, not values
- **Lifecycle Management**: You control secret creation, rotation, and deletion
- **Encryption**: Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit

### Example: AWS Chaos Experiment Secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cloud-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
data:
  cloud_config.yml: |
    # AWS credentials for chaos experiments
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <access-key>
    aws_secret_access_key = <secret-key>
    aws_session_token = <session-token>
    region = us-east-1
```

:::info Secret Security
Experiment artifacts only reference secret names. The actual secret values remain fully under your control within your Kubernetes clusters.
