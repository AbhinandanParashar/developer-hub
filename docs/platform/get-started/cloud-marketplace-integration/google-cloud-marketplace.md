This topic provides detailed information about the workflows available for purchasing Harness modules on the Google Cloud Marketplace.

### What is Google Cloud Marketplace?

The [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en) enables software vendors to offer their products and services to customers directly through Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides a convenient platform for users to discover, purchase, and deploy software solutions directly from the Google Cloud console or through APIs.

### Which Harness products are currently available on Google Cloud Marketplace?

| **Product** | **Private Offer Flow** | **Public Offer Flow** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Harness Software Delivery Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/harness-public/harness-software-delivery-platform)| Yes | No |
| [Harness Continuous Delivery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/harness-public/harness-continuous-delivery) | Yes | Yes |

### Purchase Harness products via the Google Cloud Marketplace Private Offer Flow

There are two ways you can purchase products via the Google Cloud Marketplace Private Offer Flow:

1. If you have an existing relationship with Harness, then Harness can collect the required customer details, create an offer, and send you a private offer so that you pay a custom price for the software.

2. If don't have an existing relationship with Harness and you're interested in a Harness product, you can request a custom quote for it. To contact Harness' sales team, select **Contact Sales**.

6.  Reach out to Harness sales rep that assisted with the private offer to provision the product licensing.

### How can I purchase Harness products via the Google Cloud Marketplace Public Offer Flow?

A Google Cloud Marketplace public listing refers to a software or service offering that is publicly available and accessible to all users of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). When a product or service is listed as "public" on the Google Cloud Marketplace, it means that any GCP customer can discover, evaluate, and potentially deploy that offering within their own cloud environment.

This is the self-serve model where the user can discover the product, view the pricing of the product, make the purchase, and start using the product as soon as the order/account is approved.

Harness currently offers the following products as public listings:
        *   [Harness Continuous Delivery](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/harness-public/harness-continuous-delivery)

#### Subscribe to the publicly-listed Harness product

To subscribe to a publicly-listed Harness product:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en).

2. Select **Explore the marketplace**, then search for "Harness."

3. Select the Harness product to which you want to subscribe.

   If the product is listed publicly, you can view pricing, and there is a **Subscribe** button available.

4. Select **Subscribe** to view the terms and offered plans.

5. Select the plan and finalize the subscription.

   After you select the plan and finalize the subscription, you'll be provided with two options:
   1. Sign up with the provider
   2. Manage orders

6. Select **Sign up with the provider**. option. This option takes your sign up information and creates the account for the respective email address you provided during the sign up process.

   You can now sign in and start using the product. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) if you have any questions.
