### What is Google Cloud Marketplace?
[Google Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace?hl=en) enables software vendors to offer their products and services to customers directly through Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

    ### How can customers purchase the Harness products via Google Cloud Marketplace Public Offer Flow? 
        A Google Cloud Marketplace public listing refers to a software or service offering that is publicly available and accessible to all users of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). When a product or service is listed as "public" on the Google Cloud Marketplace, it means that any GCP customer can discover, evaluate, and potentially deploy that offering within their own cloud environment. 
        
        This is the self serve model where the user can discover the product, view the pricing of the product, make the purchase and start using the product as soon as the order/account is approved.
        Harness currently offers following  products as public listings:
