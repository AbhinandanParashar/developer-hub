:::info Note
This feature is currently behind the feature flag `PIPE_CUSTOM_NOTIFICATION_TEMPLATES`.

Since this depends on centralized notifications, you'll also need the `PL_CENTRAL_NOTIFICATIONS` and `PIPE_CENTRALISED_NOTIFICATION` feature flags enabled. Please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable these features.
:::

You can configure custom notifications to receive alerts for pipeline events such as **Pipeline Start**, **Pipeline Success**, **Pipeline Failure**, and more.

This feature is especially useful when you want to:

- Include specific details like pipeline variables, stage outputs, or build inputs in your notifications.
- Send concise notifications that highlight only the most relevant information.
- Format the notification payload to match internal standards or custom structures.

### Supported Notification Channels

You can send notifications via:

1. Email/Webhook
2. Microsoft Teams
3. Datadog (`/v1/events` API)
4. Slack
5. PagerDuty
6. Webhook
