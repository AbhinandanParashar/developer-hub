Pipeline and stage status expressions can reference the `status`, `currentStatus`, or `liveStatus`. These variables track different statuses, and they can resolve differently depending on the success or failure of specific steps or stages.

`status` refers to the running status of a single node. `currentStatus` and `liveStatus` provide the combined statuses of all running steps within a pipeline or stage. The difference between status types is based on how they handle step failures and if the status of steps running in a matrix or strategy is included in the overall status calculation.

### Status

The `status` refers to the current running status of a single node, such as a pipeline, stage, or step. It provides information about the state of that specific node without considering the status of any parent, child, or sibling nodes. It reports the direct status of the target node.

Example expression: `<+pipeline.stages.STAGE_ID.status>`

### currentStatus

The `currentStatus` represents the combined status of all the running steps within a pipeline or stage, except steps generated from [matrix/repeat looping strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism.md).

`currentStatus` uses the statuses of all non-matrix steps to determines the overall status. If *any* non-matrix step fails, regardless of the progress or status of other steps, the `currentStatus` of both the pipeline and the stage resolves as `Failed`. This means that the failure of one step can affects the status of the entire pipeline or stage.

:::info

`currentStatus` *ignores* steps generated from matrix/repeat looping strategies. This means that if a pipeline includes a step generated from a matrix, and the matrix step fails while all other steps succeed, then the `currentStatus` is `Success` because `currentStatus` ignores the matrix step.

Example expression: `<+pipeline.stages.STAGE_ID.currentStatus>`

### liveStatus

Like `currentStatus`, `liveStatus` also provides the combined status of all the running steps within a pipeline or stage; however it also considers the status of steps generated from [matrix/repeat looping strategies](/docs/platform/pipelines/looping-strategies/looping-strategies-matrix-repeat-and-parallelism.md).

`liveStatus` considers the statuses of *all* steps to determine the overall status. If *any* step fails, the `liveStatus` of both the pipeline and the stage resolves as `Failed`, regardless of the individual status of running or completed steps.

:::info

`liveStatus` *includes* steps generated by matrix/repeat looping strategies. This means that if a pipeline includes a step generated from a matrix, and the matrix step fails while all other steps succeed, then the `liveStatus` is `Failed` because `liveStatus` includes the matrix step.

Example expression: `<+pipeline.stages.stage1.liveStatus>`

### Example: Status determination

The following example describes an ongoing execution with three steps named `step1`, `step2`, and `step3` within a stage called `stage1`.

`step1` is executed using a matrix strategy, specifically with two values: `"john"` and `"doe"`.

Assume this pipeline is running and the stage, steps, and matrix instances of `step3` have the following statuses:

- `stage1`: Running
- `step1`: Success
- `step2`: Success
- `step3` (matrix): Running
   - `"john"`: Failed
   - `"doe"`: Success

In this example, the status values for `stage1` are as follows:

- The `status` of `stage1` is `Running`. This is taken directly from the execution status of `stage1`.
- The `currentStatus` of `stage1` is `Success`. This is determined from the statuses of all steps in the stage, excluding the matrix steps generated by `step3`.
- The `liveStatus` of `stage1` is `Failed`. This is determined by considering the statuses of all steps in the stage, including the matrix steps generated by `step3`.
