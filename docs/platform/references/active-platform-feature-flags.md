### What are feature flags

Feature flags are a way that developers can conditionally turn certain sections of their code (or code paths) on or off. You can think of feature flags as an extension or a way to put changes into production behind a flag and turn them on in a controlled way later (or hide and remove them in the same way). They form the basis of feature flag.
