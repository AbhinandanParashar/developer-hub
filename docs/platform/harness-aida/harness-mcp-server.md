# Harness MCP Server

The Harness Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables integration with Harness tools, providing endpoints for pipelines, pull requests, and more. This guide outlines the installation, configuration, and usage of the MCP server.

## Introduction to MCP Server

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an **open standard for AI agents to interact with tools and services** using a unified protocol. Instead of building custom adapters or connectors for each tool, MCP provides a consistent interface that allows AI agents to communicate seamlessly with various tools, including Harness services.

**In simpler terms:** MCP standardizes how AI agents talk to software tools, enabling interoperability without requiring custom code for each integration.

### Why MCP?

Harness is building a diverse set of AI agents that need access to platform data and services. Additionally, customers may have their own agents that require interaction with Harness entities to perform specific tasks.

MCP solves this problem by:

* **Standardizing communication:** A single interface for connecting agents to Harness tools, reducing implementation complexity.
* **Supporting external tools:** Seamless integration with third-party tools like **Windsurf, Cursor, and Claude Desktop**, eliminating the need for custom adapters.
* **Ensuring consistency:** A common interface reduces duplication and potential inconsistencies across different agents and tools.

### MCP vs. Tool/Function Calling

Why not just use function calls for each API?

1. **Limited Support for External Tools:** Function calling is often restricted to the modelâ€™s internal tools. MCP enables integration with external tools like Windsurf, Cursor, and Claude Desktop.
2. **Inconsistent Implementations:** Without MCP, each agent would need to implement the same logic in different languages/frameworks, increasing the risk of errors.
3. **Scalability and Reuse:** MCP provides a standardized protocol, allowing reusable implementations across various agents and tools.

## Requirements

* **Harness API Token:** Generate one through the Harness UI. Learn more: [Manage API Keys](/docs/platform/automation/api/add-and-manage-api-keys/)
* **Go 1.23 or later:** Ensure **Go** is installed on your system.
