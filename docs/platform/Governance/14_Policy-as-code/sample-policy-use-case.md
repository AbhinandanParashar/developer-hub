Currently, this feature is behind the feature flag `OPA_PIPELINE_GOVERNANCE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.
:::

Harness provides governance using Open Policy Agent (OPA), policy management, and Rego policies.
You can enforce policies in the following ways:

You can enforce policies in the following ways: 

* Enforce policies at a scope: Create a policy and apply it to all pipelines in your account, organization, and project. Policy evaluation occurs on pipeline-level events like On Run and On Save.
For more information, go to [Harness Policy As Code quickstart](/docs/platform/Governance/Policy-as-code/harness-governance-quickstart).

* Enforce policies at any stage: Create a policy step, add a policy set, and provide a JSON payload. Whenever the pipeline reaches the policy step, policy evaluation occurs. Data such as resolved expressions can be evaluated when the pipeline runs. Evaluating policies can lead to pipeline execution failures.

This topic describes how to add a policy step to a stage.

## Policy samples


### Connector policy samples

#### Enforce authorization type while configuring a Kubernetes connector

To enforce a specific authentication type, use the following policy. This prevents users from setting up connectors that may not be in compliance or standard with the account owner's guidelines. You can execute this policy **On Connector Save**. 

```TEXT
package connector

import future.keywords.in

# Choose a connector type to check
connectorType := "K8sCluster"
# Choose one or more allowed auth types for the above connector type
allowedAuthTypes := ["UsernamePassword"]

deny[msg] {
	cType := input.entity.type
	aType := input.entity.spec.credential.spec.auth.type

	# This will deny when both of the below conditions are true
	cType == connectorType
	not aType in allowedAuthTypes

	msg := sprintf("Auth types %s are allowed for connector type %s, used '%s'", [allowedAuthTypes, cType, aType])
}

```

#### Enforce access control for a specific connector at runtime while configuring the pipeline

The administrator can control which users can select a specific connector for pipeline configuration and pipeline execution.

Use the following policy to enforce which users and user groups can deploy and build using the connector:

```TEXT
package connector

# Choose a connector type to check
connectorType := "K8sCluster"
# Choose one or more user groups, identified by the "indentifier" property
AllowedUserGroups := ["_project_all_users"]

deny[msg] {
	cType := input.entity.type

	# Check the connector type is the one we need
	cType == connectorType

	# Check the user groups from the connector are contained in the allowed list
	not contains(input.metadata.userGroups)

	msg := sprintf("Only user groups %s are allowed for connector type %s'", [AllowedUserGroups, cType])
}

contains(userGroups) {
	identifier := userGroups[_].identifier
	AllowedUserGroups[_] = identifier
}
```

#### Admins want to enforce the connector naming conventions when users add a new connector

Use the following policy to enforce naming conventions for connectors created in the Harness account.
You can apply this policy on Connector Save.

```TEXT
package connectors

# Deny connectors whose names do not follow the correct naming convention
# e.g. "Lion - Data Store" is allowed but "Cool connector" is not
# NOTE: Try setting the name to "Test" to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	not regex.match("[Cheetah|Tiger|Lion]\\s[-]\\s[a-zA-Z0-9\\s]+", input.entity.name)
	msg := sprintf("Connector name '%s' must follow the correct naming convention 'Team - Account'", [input.entity.name])
}
```

### Pipeline enforcement policy samples

#### Admins want to prevent other developers from deploying into a non-compliant environment.

The below policy enforces `On Pipeline Run`. User's can enforce policies on which environment the developer can deploy to.

```TEXT
package pipeline

# Deny pipelines that do not use allowed environments
# NOTE: Try removing "test" from the 'allowed_environments' list to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	# Find all deployment stages
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage
	stage.type == "Deployment"

	# ... where the environment is not in the allow list
	not contains(allowed_environments, stage.spec.infrastructure.environment.identifier)

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := sprintf("deployment stage '%s' cannot be deployed to environment '%s'", [stage.name, stage.spec.infrastructure.environment.identifier])
}

# Deny pipelines if the environment is missing completely
deny[msg] {
	# Find all deployment stages
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage
	stage.type == "Deployment"

	# ... without an environment
	not stage.spec.infrastructure.environment.identifier

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := sprintf("deployment stage '%s' has no environment identifier", [stage.name])
}

# Environments that can be used for deployment
allowed_environments = ["demoprod","stage"]

contains(arr, elem) {
	arr[_] = elem
}
```

#### Enforcing the container registry selected for building and publishing code

Admin's want to restrict and prevent users from publishing images to public repos, only approve repos can be used. Below policy can be executed `On Pipeline Run`

```TEXT
package pipeline

# Deny build pipelines that don't push to "us.gcr.io"
# NOTE: Try changing the expected host to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	# Find all stages ...
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# ... that are used for CI
	stage.type == "CI"

	# ... that have steps
	step = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step

	# ... that build and push to GCR steps
	step.type == "BuildAndPushGCR"

	# ... and do not target "us.gcr.io"
	step.spec.host != "us.gcr.io"

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("CI stage '%s' cannot push images to host '%s'", [stage.name, step.spec.host])
}
```

#### Prevent users from leveraging steps that are not allowed by the company

Some users want to restrict developers from using specific steps in their pipelines. We can enforce this `on pipeline save` and `on pipeline run`.

```TEXT
package pipeline

# Deny pipelines that are missing required steps
# NOTE: Try adding "HarnessApproval" to the 'forbidden_steps' list to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	# Find all stages ...
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# ... that are deployments
	stage.type == "Deployment"

	# Find all steps in each stage ...
	step = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step

	# ... that use forbidden types
	forbidden_steps[_] = step.type

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := sprintf("deployment stage '%s' has step '%s' that is forbidden type '%s'", [stage.name, step.name, step.type])
}

# Steps that should not used in deployments
forbidden_steps = ["ShellScript"]

contains(arr, elem) {
	arr[_] = elem
}
```

#### Enforcing a deployment freeze via policy

Admin's may configure a deployment freeze via Policy to supplement the formal deployment freeze feature. The policy route is great for one off freezes that are set by the business. This policy is set on `Pipeline Run`

```TEXT
package pipeline

# Deny when the current date is after a start date and before an end date
# Could be used for deployment freezes
deny[msg] {
	freezeStart := time.parse_rfc3339_ns("2022-11-18T00:00:00+00:00")
	freezeEnd := time.parse_rfc3339_ns("2022-11-20T00:00:00+00:00")
	now := time.now_ns()

	now > freezeStart
	now < freezeEnd

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := "Deployment is currently frozen from 18th Nov to 20th Nov"
}

```


### Feature Flag policies

#### Prevent feature flags from being enabled in production that are not configured in a lower environment like stage

This policy can be enforced on Feature Flags. It can ensure the configuration of the Flag is properly governed by the end user.

```TEXT
package feature_flags

# Deny flags that are enabled in "production" but not in "stage"
# NOTE: Try changing the "production" stage to be on to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	# Match flags where the "production" environment is on ...
	prod := input.flag.envProperties[_]
	prod.environment == "production"
	prod.state == "on"

	# ... and the "stage" environment is off
	stage := input.flag.envProperties[_]
	stage.environment == "stage"
	stage.state == "off"

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := sprintf(`Flag '%s' cannot be enabled in "production" because it is disabled in "stage"`, [input.flag.name])
}
```

####  Users want to enforce the flag types that are configured for Feature Flags

Users can enforce that feature flags are configured with boolean value. This can be configured on when Feature Flag Creation.

```TEXT
package feature_flags

# Deny flags that aren't "boolean"
# NOTE: Try adding changing the flag 'kind' to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	input.flag.kind != "boolean"
	msg := sprintf(`Flag '%s' isn't of type "boolean"`, [input.flag.name])
}
```

#### Users want to deny the creation of feature flags that serve true by default. 

This protects users from configuring flags and serving true to all the end users of the flag. This allows for a safer rollout of the flag. This can be configured on feature flag configuration.

```TEXT
package feature_flags

# Deny flags that serve true by default when turned off to prevent accidentally enabling the flag
# NOTE: Try setting the 'defaultOnVariation' to true to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	input.flag.defaultOnVariation != "false"
	msg := sprintf("Flag '%s' does not have default 'on' value of false", [input.flag.name])
}

# Deny flags that serve true by default when turned on to prevent accidentally enabling the flag
# NOTE: Try setting the 'defaultOffVariation' to true to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	input.flag.defaultOffVariation != "false"
	msg := sprintf("Flag '%s' does not have default 'off' value of false", [input.flag.name])
}
```

#### Users want to enforce naming conventions for their Feature flags

On Feature Flag Save, users can enforce the naming convention of the flags to ensure that no one falls outside the porper naming standards for internal flags. This ensures good feature flag hygenie.

```TEXT
package feature_flags

# Deny flags whose names do not contain a validly formatted Jira ticket number
# e.g. "FFM-123" is allowed but "Cool flag" is not
# NOTE: Try setting the name to "Test" to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	not regex.match("[FFM|OPA|CI|CD]+[-][1-9][0-9]?", input.flag.name)
	msg := sprintf("Flag name '%s' doesn't contain a Jira ticket number", [input.flag.name])
}
```

### Template policy samples

#### Enforce the use of stable templates in a pipeline

This policy enforces the correct version of a template is used in the pipeline. It can be applied `On Pipeline Save` or `On Pipeline Run` 

```TEXT
package pipeline

template := "my_template"
stableVersion := "1"

# Deny a pipeline if the stage uses the template above
# without the stable version stated
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# Check if the stage matches but doesn't have a template
	stage.template.templateRef == template
	stage.template.versionLabel != stableVersion

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf(
		"Stage %s, has template %s, with version %s, it should be version %s",
		[stage.name, template, stage.template.versionLabel, stableVersion],
	)
}

# Deny a pipeline if the step uses the template above
# without the stable version stated
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage
	step = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step

	# Check if the stage matches but doesn't have a template
	step.template.templateRef == template
	step.template.versionLabel != stableVersion

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf(
		"Step %s in stage %s, , has template %s, with version %, it should be version %s",
		[step.name, stage.name, template, stage.template.versionLabel, stableVersion],
	)
}
```


#### Enforce a Stage templates use in a Pipeline

Users may want to enforce an approved stage template in a pipeline. This policy can be executed `On Pipeline Save` or `On Pipelne Run`.

```TEXT
package pipeline

stageType := "Deployment"
template := "my_stage_template"

# Deny a pipeline if the stage type above does not
# have a template at all
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# Check if the stage matches but doesn't have a template
	stage.type == stageType
	not stage.template

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("Stage %s has no template, it must use template %s", [stage.name, template])
}

# Deny a pipeline if the stage type above does not
# use the template and version required
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# Check if the stage matches but the template ref
	# or version are not matching
	stage.type == stageType
	stage.template.templateRef != template

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("Stage %s uses the wrong template, it must use template %s", [stage.name, template])
}

```

#### Enforce step templates to be used in a pipeline

Users can enforce the step template being used in a Pipeline. It ensures the correct steps and approved steps are leveraged `On Pipeline Save` or  `On Pipeline Run`.

```TEXT
package pipeline

stepType := "Policy"
template := "my_template"

# Deny a pipeline if the step type above does not
# have a template at all
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage
	step = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step

	# Check if the step matches but doesn't have a template
	step.type == stepType
	not step.template

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("In stage %s, step %s has no template, it must use template %s", [stage.name, step.name, template])
}

# Deny a pipeline if the step type above does not
# use the template and version required
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage
	step = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step

	# Check if the step matches but the template ref
	# or version are not matching
	step.type == stepType
	step.template.templateRef != template

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("In stage %s, step %s uses the wrong template, it must use template %s", [stage.name, step.name, template])
}
```

#### Enforce a pipeline's stage structure

Users may want to make sure pipelines are designed with the recommended or mandatory structure. This ensures pipeline designers have the freedom to design a pipeline while following the guard rails. This policy works `On Pipeline Save`

```TEXT
package pipeline

stage_order := ["OPA check", "deploy"]

# Deny a pipeline if stages do not execute in the
# correct order. This will check that the named stages
# in the array above are in the right order, ignoring
# other stages.
deny[msg] {
	# Run through the order rules array
	item = stage_order[i]
	prev = stage_order[i - 1]
	index = getIndex(item, input.pipeline.stages)
	prevIndex = getIndex(prev, input.pipeline.stages)

	# Makes sure the current rule is after the previous
	# rule in the step order
	index < prevIndex

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("Stage order is incorrect %s should be after %s", [item, prev])
}

getIndex(str, stages) = result {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[i].stage
	str == stage.name
	result = i
}
```

#### Enforce a steps in a pipeline

Users can ensure that mandaroty steps are configured in a pipeline. This policy can be configured `On Pipeline Run`, or `On Pipeline Save`

```TEXT

ppackage pipeline

# Deny pipelines that are missing required steps
# NOTE: Try adding "ShellScript" to the 'required_steps' list to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	# Find all stages ...
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# ... that are deployments
	stage.type == "Deployment"

	# ... and create a list of all step types in use
	existing_steps := [s | s = stage.spec.execution.steps[_].step.type]

	# For each required step ...
	required_step := required_steps[_]

	# ... check if it's present in the existing steps
	not contains(existing_steps, required_step)

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg := sprintf("deployment stage '%s' is missing required step '%s'", [stage.name, existing_steps])
}

# Steps that must be present in every deployment
required_steps = ["JiraUpdate","HarnessApproval"]

contains(arr, elem) {
	arr[_] = elem
}
```

#### Enforce step order in a pipeline

Users may want to enforce the ordering of steps that are configured in a pipeline. This policy can be used `On Pipeline Save` or `On Pipeline Run`.

```TEXT
package pipeline

step_order := ["Get version", "Run OPA policy"]

# Deny a pipeline if steps do not execute in the
# correct order, this will check the steps in every
# stage
deny[msg] {
	stage = input.pipeline.stages[_].stage

	# Run through the order rules array
	item = step_order[i]
	prev = step_order[i - 1]
	index = getIndex(item, stage)
	prevIndex = getIndex(prev, stage)

	# Makes sure the current rule is after the previous
	# rule in the step order
	index < prevIndex

	# Show a human-friendly error message
	msg = sprintf("Step order is incorrect %s should be after %s", [item, prev])
}


getIndex(str, stage) = result {
	item = stage.spec.execution.steps[i]
	str == item.step.name
	result = i
}
```

### Secret policy samples

#### Ensure there are no principals in the secret secrets.

Users want to ensure that the secrets configured in Harness are configured by the correct group. This policy can be configured on Secret Save time.

```TEXT
package secret

import future.keywords.in

# The identifiers for one or more principals allowed to save secrets
allowedPrincipals = ["1234abcd"]

deny["Principal is not allowed to save secrets"] {
	# If the principal is not in the allowed principals list, deny.
	not input.metadata.principalIdentifier in allowedPrincipals
}
```

#### Enforce secret naming conventions

Users want to ensure that developers add secrets to Harness with a common naming standard, this makes it easy to identify and manage them. This can be configured on secret save.

```TEXT
package secrets

# Deny secrets whose names do not follow the correct naming convention
# e.g. "Lion - MongoDB Password" is allowed but "Cool secret" is not
# NOTE: Try setting the name to "Test" to see the policy fail
deny[msg] {
	not regex.match("[Cheetah|Tiger|Lion]\\s[-]\\s[a-zA-Z0-9\\s]+", input.secret.name)
	msg := sprintf("Secret name '%s' must follow the correct naming convention 'Team - Purpose'", [input.secret.name])
}
```

#### Enforce what secrets manager can be used to save secrets.

Users may want to enforce their secrets configured in Harness to be stored to a particular secrets manager. This policy can be enforced on pipeline save.

```TEXT
package secrets

import future.keywords.in

# Choose one or more allowed providers based on there identifier
allowedProviders := ["harnessSecretManager"]

deny[msg] {
	# Check that the secret manager identifier exists in the white list
	not input.secret.spec.secretManagerIdentifier in allowedProviders
	msg := sprintf("Only %s are allowed as providers", [allowedProviders])
}
```
