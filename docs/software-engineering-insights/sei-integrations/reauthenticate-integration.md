If your integration health is failing due to expired credentials, you can easily re-authenticate by following these steps to update your access token:

* Go to the **Integrations**, and select your integration from the **Your Integrations** tab.

* Click on **Monitoring**.

* Click on the **Change Authentication** button at the top right corner.

* Follow the prompts and enter your email and the new **API Key**.

* Click **Validate Connection** to complete the re-authentication process.
 
By following these steps, you'll successfully re-authenticate with the Jira platform using your new access token, resolving any issues caused by expired credentials.
