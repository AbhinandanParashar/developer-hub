This guide highlights recommended CI/CD reports and metrics for the Harness integration to help teams track job frequency, success, duration, and lead time, driving continuous improvement in delivery workflows.

In this guide, weâ€™ll outline recommended SCM metrics for GitLab, focusing on actionable insights that enhance team performance and efficiency.

## Key widgets

### Job and pipeline run frequency

Use these widgets to track the frequency of job and pipeline executions and observe success or failure trends over time. Tracking CI/CD job counts can help identify periods of high activity, recurring failures, and any anomalies in job runs.

* CICD Job Count Report
* CICD Pipeline Jobs Count Report
* CICD Job Count Trend Report
* CICD Jobs Count Single Stat

### Job/pipeline duration

Analyzing job duration can help to optimize build times and streamline CI/CD workflows. Duration widgets provide insights into the time taken for jobs to run, allowing teams to pinpoint jobs that could benefit from optimization.

* CI/CD Job Duration Report
* CI/CD Job Duration Single Stat
* CI/CD Job Duration Trend Report

### Measure lead time

The Harness CI/CD integration can be used to configure the Workflow profile for measuring the lead time metric. Tracking lead time for changes is essential to understanding how quickly new code reaches production. The CI/CD stages in Lead Time can highlights areas in the CI/CD pipeline that may require optimization to improve the build time or delivery speed.

* Lead Time for Changes (DORA widget)
* Lead Time reports (Velocity Lead Time widgets)
