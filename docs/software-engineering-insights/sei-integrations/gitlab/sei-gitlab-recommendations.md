For engineering leaders it is essential for analyzing activity in your GitLab repositories, providing insights into contributions, collaboration, and process efficiency. The SCM widgets in SEI can be used with the GitLab integration to enable leaders to monitor developer productivity, track rework, and identify trends in pull requests (PRs) and code reviews.

This topic includes recommendations on some of the most popular widgets that are used to measure developer metrics while using the GitLab integration.

## Key widgets

### Developer contributions

Monitor individual contributions to understand how often developers are committing code and contributing to the codebase. These metrics can highlight engagement, focus areas, and workload distribution among team members. The following widgets are commonly used:

* SCM Coding Days Report: Tracks the number of days where developers actively commit code, helping identify patterns in coding activity.
* SCM Coding Days Single Stat: Summarizes coding activity with a single stat for coding days, providing a quick snapshot of engagement at the individual or team level.

### Pull request activity

Use SCM PR widgets to analyze the flow of PRs through your repositories, assess PR lead time, and understand team collaboration during reviews. These widgets help identify bottlenecks, improve efficiency, and ensure code quality through better collaboration.

* SCM PRs Report Provides a high-level view of PRs, showing how efficiently PRs move through the lifecycle from open to merge.
* SCM PRs Single Stat: Highlights a single stat related to PR activity, allowing for a quick, targeted view of a specific PR metric.
* SCM PR Lead Time by Stage Report: Analyzes lead time based on PR lifecycle stages. Drill down by project, repository, or timeframe to assess specific bottlenecks and evaluate PR efficiency.
* SCM Review Collaboration Report: Evaluates code review quality by examining if PRs were approved before merging. This report is valuable for understanding team collaboration and ensuring code quality through structured reviews.

### Code rework and quality

Understanding rework is essential to improving code quality and maintaining high standards in development. The SCM Rework widget tracks rework volumes over time, helping teams identify which areas of code are more prone to revisions and need improvement.
