Use the SEI Bitbucket connector to integrate SEI with Bitbucket Cloud.

To integrate with the on-premises offering, Bitbucket Data Center, you must use the [generic SEI connector](./sei-connector-generic.md).

## Requirements

The following permissions and settings are required to use the SEI Bitbucket connector:

* You have a Bitbucket account.
* Your role is **Member** or higher.

## Configure the connector

1. In your Harness project, go to the SEI module, and select **Account**.
2. Select **SEI Connectors** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Connectors**, locate the **Bitbucket** connector, and select **Install**.
4. Configure and save the connector.

   * If you are redirected to Bitbucket, select **Grant Access** to allow the integration. You might need to sign in. Bitbucket uses OAuth authentication.
   * Enter a **Name** for the connector.
   * The **Description** and **Tags** are optional.
