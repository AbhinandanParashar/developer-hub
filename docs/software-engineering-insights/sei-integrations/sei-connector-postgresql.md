PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

Use the SEI PostgreSQL connector to integrate SEI with a Cloud-based PostgreSQL instance.

:::info

This SEI connector is under development. It provides limited integration support in its current state.

:::

To integrate with an on-premises PostgreSQL instance, you must use the [generic SEI connector](./sei-connector-generic.md).

## Configure the connector

1. In your Harness project, go to the SEI module, and select **Account**.
2. Select **SEI Connectors** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Connectors**, locate the **PostgreSQL** connector, and select **Install**.
4. Configure and save the connector.
