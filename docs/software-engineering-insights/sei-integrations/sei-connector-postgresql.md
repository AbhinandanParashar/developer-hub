PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

Use the SEI PostgreSQL integration to integrate SEI with a Cloud-based PostgreSQL instance.

:::info

This SEI integration is under development. It provides limited integration support in its current state.

:::

To integrate with an on-premises PostgreSQL instance, you must use the [generic SEI integration](./sei-connector-generic.md).

## Configure the integration

1. In your Harness project, go to the SEI module, and select **Account**.
2. Select **SEI Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Select **Available Integrations**, locate the **PostgreSQL** integration, and select **Install**.
4. Configure and save the integration.
