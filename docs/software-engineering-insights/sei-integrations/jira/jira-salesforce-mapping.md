If you also have an [SEI Salesforce integration](/docs/software-engineering-insights/sei-integrations/other-integrations/sei-integration-salesforce), you can link Salesforce tickets to Jira issues by using a custom Jira field.

1. In your **Harness Project**, select the **SEI Module**, and go to your **Account**.
2. Select **Integrations** under **Data Settings**.
3. Find your **Jira** integration and edit it.
4. Under **Salesforce Field Mapping**, select the Jira field that contains your Salesforce case IDs.
5. Click **Save** to save the define settings.
