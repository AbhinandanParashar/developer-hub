Use the generic SEI connector for integrations that don't have an application-specific connector or when your configuration doesn't support the application-specific connector, including:

* On-premise tools and integrations that historically used *Ingestion Satellites*.
* The *Job Reporter Plugin* for Jenkins.
* Custom CI/CD integrations.
* Other tools that don't have an application-specific connector.

## On-premise integrations (formerly Ingestion Satellites)

## Jenkins plugin

## Custom CI/CI integrations
