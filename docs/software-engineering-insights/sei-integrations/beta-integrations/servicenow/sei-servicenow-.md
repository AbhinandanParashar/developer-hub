:::info
The SEI ServiceNow integration is currently in BETA and is accessible behind the Feature Flag `<SEI_SERVICENOW>`. Please contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature.
:::

ServiceNow is used to set up systems that define, manage, automate and structure IT services for companies. You can use the SEI ServiceNow integration to integrate SEI with ServiceNow Cloud and ServiceNow On-Prem accounts.

This integration allows you to track, manage, and analyze incidents, and change requests in real-time, leading to improved efficiency and enhanced productivity.

## Requirements

### OAuth Credentials

To configure the integration using OAuth-based authentication, you'll need to generate the following credentials in your ServiceNow instance:

* [ServiceNow Client ID](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow)
* [ServiceNow Client Secret](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow)

These credentials are essential for secure, token-based authentication between your application and the ServiceNow platform. To generate the credentials, go to [Create a Client ID and Client Secret in ServiceNow](#create-a-client-id-and-client-secret-in-servicenow)

### Required permissions

When configuring the ServiceNow integration, ensure the user has the following roles:

* **itil:** Provides access to IT Service Management (ITSM) functionalities.
* **oauth_admin:** Required only if using the OAuth flow for creating integrations. This role allows management of OAuth applications.
* **personalize_choices:** Enables customization of choice lists.
* **personalize_dictionary:** Allows modification of dictionary entries.

To fetch data for all users within the ServiceNow instance, the following roles are required:

* **user:** Basic role assigned to all ServiceNow users.
* **user_admin:** Provides administrative capabilities over user accounts.

### Create a Client ID and Client Secret in ServiceNow

To create a Client ID and Client Secret in ServiceNow, follow these steps:

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Oauth" label="OAuth">

* Add the **Name** for the integration, which is mandatory. You can add **Description** and **Tags** (Optional).

Hereâ€™s a sample `satellite.yml` file:

```yaml
satellite:
  tenant: <ACCOUNT_NAME>
  api_key: <SEI_API_KEY>
  url: <SEI_ENV_URL>
integrations:
  - id: <INTEGRATION_ID>
    url: <SERVICENOW_URL>
    username: <SERVICENOW_USERNAME>
    application: servicenow
    api_key: <SERVICENOW_PASSWORD>
```

## Recommendations

The ServiceNow integration primarily is used for measuring the incident recovery time using the DORA Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) widget.

For detailed instructions on setting up and configuring the DORA profile to effectively measure MTTR using the ServiceNow integration, please refer to [Measure incident recovery time](/docs/software-engineering-insights/early-access/metrics-reports/mttr-incident-recovery).
