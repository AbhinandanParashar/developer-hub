Harness SEI is currently available to a limited set of customers. To get started, send an email to support@harness.io for a demo and a Harness specialist will get you going.

Once Harness SEI is enabled in your account, an account administrator can help you configure your integrations and create the required Insights.

If the module is enabled and you are an account administrator, go to [SEI Onboarding Guide](/docs/software-engineering-insights/get-started/sei-onboarding-guide).
