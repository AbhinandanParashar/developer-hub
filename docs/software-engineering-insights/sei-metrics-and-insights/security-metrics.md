SEI [integrates](/docs/category/connectors-and-integrations) with some of the best security tools to produce reports that help you analyze anomalies or threats that can lead to failures and data loss or corruption.

* **Coverity Issues Report:** This report helps track the progress of the issues reported by the Coverity application. Coverity is a fast, accurate, and highly scalable static analysis (SAST) solution that helps development and security teams address security and quality defects early in the software development life cycle.
* **Microsoft Threat Modeling Issues Report:** This report helps track the progress of the issues reported by the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool. This tool allows software architects to identify and mitigate potential security issues early, when they are relatively easy and cost-effective to resolve.
* **NCC Group Vulnerability Report:** This report provides details on detected vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can be categorized by status. The NCC Group's Managed Vulnerability Scanning Services deliver hands-on rapid detection, monitoring, and remediation of internal and external system vulnerabilities.
* **Snyk Vulnerability Report:** This report provides details on detected vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities can be categorized by project, severity, or other factors. Snyk is an automated vulnerability testing tool that monitors for misconfigurations or coding flaws that pose cybersecurity threats.
