Effort investment, also known as alignment, helps you analyze how engineering teams invest their efforts and align with business needs and strategic initiatives. With these metrics, you can:

* Pinpoint wasteful unplanned work, maximize engineering ROI, and reduce waste.
* Measure PM-Engineering collaboration, eliminate back and forth, and endeavor to _build it right the first time_.
* Evaluate offshore, outsourced, and vendor decisions, and quantify these contributions to determine the best options.
* Maximize software cost capitalization by automatically determining software development time for accounting reports.

:::tip

Effort investment metrics are driven by [Investment profiles](../../sei-profiles/investment-profile.md).

Use [Business Alignment Insights](../../sei-insights.md#create-a-business-alignment-insights) to observe these metrics.
