### TestRail Test Report

When configuring this widget, on the **Metrics** tab, you can select either **Test Cases** (number of test cases) or **Tests** (number of test executions).

:::caution

Each metric has different options for **Columns**, **Filters**, **Stacks**, and **Aggregations**. Switching from **Test Cases** to **Tests** and vice versa resets the linked settings.

The **Tests** metric provides more options for **Columns**, **Filters**, **Stacks**, and **Aggregations**. Neither metric supports custom fields.
