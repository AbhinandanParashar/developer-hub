Asset governance policies play a crucial role in governing and optimizing costs by enforcing governance rules. However, authoring these policies can be challenging and confusing at times. In such situations, the Harness AIDA (AI Development Assistant) support can be extremely valuable in assisting with policy creation. Harness AIDA offers a user-friendly interface and serves as an excellent starting point for establishing the necessary policies. By leveraging this tool, organizations can streamline the process of policy development and ensure that the required policies are effectively implemented.

The Harness AIDA offers comprehensive support with the following functionalities:

* Assists in writing rules based on specific requirements: Helps you formulate rules tailored to your specific needs. By understanding your requirements, it generates customized rules to align with your governance objectives.
* Provides descriptions of existing rules: Offers detailed descriptions of pre-existing rules. This feature allows you to gain a clear understanding of the purpose, scope, and implications of each rule, facilitating informed decision-making during the policy creation process.
