This section will guide you through creating a new chaos dashboard, and creating custom visualizations.

## Before you begin

Refer to [overview of chaos dashboards](./overview) to understand what a chaos dashboard is, and how you can view a predefined chaos dashboard.

## Create a dashboard

### Step 1: Click Dashboard
To create a new dashboard, click **Dashboard**.
<!-- ![click-dashboard](./static/overview/click-dashboard.png)) -->

### Step 2: Specify parameters
Add values for **Folder**, **Name**, and **Tags** (compulsory). Click **Continue**. This creates an empty dashboard. You can add visualizations (also known as **panels**) by editing this dashboard.
<!--![specify-params](./static/overview/specify-params.png)) -->

### Step 3: Edit previously created dashboard
Click **Edit Dashboard**. Click **Add** and select **Visualization**.
<!--![edit-dashboard](./static/overview/edit-dashboard.png)) -->

:::tip
Don't forget to add the **Tag** values because this is the value based on which the dashboards are filtered by modules.

### Step 4: Select a table
Select a table whose fields you wish to visualize. HCE currently supports **Chaos experiment runs**, **Chaos experiments**, **Chaos hub**, and **Chaos infrastructures**.

### Step 5: Select fields
Select the 2 or more fields whose representation you wish to view.
