This guide describes the basic steps for getting started with Harness Chaos Engineering.

## Basic steps to create a chaos experiment

To create a chaos experiment, complete the following steps:
1. [Fulfill the resource requirements](../configure-chaos-experiments/prerequisites)
2. [Add an environment](../chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-1-create-an-environment)
3. [Add a chaos infrastructure](../chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-2-add-a-chaos-infrastructure)
4. [Validate the chaos infrastructure installation](../chaos-infrastructure/connect-chaos-infrastructures#step-3-validate-the-chaos-infrastructure-installation)
5. [Create a demo application](../../../tutorials/chaos-experiments/first-chaos-engineering#creating-a-demo-application-and-observability-infrastructure)
6. [Create and run a chaos experiment](../configure-chaos-experiments/experiments/construct-and-run-custom-chaos-experiments) 


## Next steps

* Follow this [tutorial](../../../tutorials/chaos-experiments/first-chaos-engineering) to execute your first chaos experiment.
* [Execute experiments in a sandbox](./run-experiments-in-sandbox)
