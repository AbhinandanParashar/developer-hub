# AI Reliability Engineer

The AI Reliability Engineer feature enhances your chaos engineering capabilities by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate and optimize reliability testing and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Automated Reliability Analysis**: Leverage AI to automatically analyze system behavior during chaos experiments
- **Intelligent Fault Detection**: Identify potential failure points before they impact production
<!-- - **Autonomous Remediation**: Configure AI-driven autonomous remediation for common failure scenarios -->

## Getting Started

### 1. Enable the Feature Flag

- Reach out to your Harness sales representative to enable the AI Reliability Engineer feature flag for your account

### 2. Set Up Your First AI Reliability Analysis

Once the feature flag is enabled:

1. Navigate to your Harness Chaos Engineering module
2. Go to **Environments** in the left navigation menu, choose the environment you want to enable AI Reliability Engineer for
3. You can either:
   - Select an existing infrastructure and click the **More Options** menu (â‹®) then select **Edit**
   - Or click **+ New Infrastructure** to create a new one
4. In the infrastructure edit panel, locate the **Enable AI** toggle at the top
5. Turn on the toggle to enable Harness AI Agent to perform tasks on this infrastructure
