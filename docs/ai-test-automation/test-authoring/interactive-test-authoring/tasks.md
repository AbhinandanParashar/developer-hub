Tasks are reusable functions designed to perform a series of commonly used steps. In AI Test Automation, there are two types of tasks: **Login tasks** and **General tasks**. Login tasks, the most frequently used, are designed to capture credentials and are automatically included in any test during its creation and execution. General tasks, on the other hand, are manually added by the test creator, who selects them from a list of available tasks.

Login tasks ([Create a login task](<./../../GETTING STARTED/Create a login task.md>) ) are created through interactive authoring, while General tasks are defined by selecting a series of consecutive steps in the test details page.&#x20;

Once a test is created and you think a set of consecutive steps will be reused in various other tests then you can simply select the steps and create a task. Once the task is created you can add the task to any new test in interactive authoring or during Editing.&#x20;

## Adding a task to a test&#x20;

During test authoring, you can add a task to a test by selecting one from the list.&#x20;

Once added, simply click on the `Continue` button at the top of the step panel to execute all the task steps and make it part of the test definition&#x20;
