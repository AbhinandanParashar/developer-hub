Step into the future of test authoring with Relicx Copilot, the revolutionary feature that harnesses the power of Generative AI. Experience the ease and efficiency of creating robust and resilient tests in minutes using natural language, eliminating the worry of test breakage as your application evolves.

### How to author Copilot tasks  during interactive authoring ?

Here we simply instruct Relicx Copilot to perform a specific task and it figures out the required steps. Here in the example below we have asked Copilot to deposit $40 to the savings account&#x20;

The Copilot parses the steps and then performs the required action without any supervision. Once the task is done, Copilot returns back the control to the user and the user can either ask the Copilot to proceed or continue to author the test interactively.&#x20;
