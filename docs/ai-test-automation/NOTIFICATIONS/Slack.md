Relicx allows you to integrate your slack workspace with you Relicx Org. The process is very straightforward and you need to invoke the integration from `Settings --> Slack ( Under Notifications and Alerts)`

As the first step, please click on the slack icon to initiate the slack app integration process. You will need admin rights to your workspace to do this step. Once this is done, you can add the following notifications for each app that you may have created in Relicx&#x20;
