In the Add Application screen, you would enter a display name for your application. This is usually the name that you use to refer to it. The application URL is the URL to your test environment which would be used for authoring tests. Please make sure this URL is accessible from the public cloud.&#x20;

You can now start creating test on this new application

### Define Application Environments

A unique aspect of Relicx is that it interacts with your application across the release cycle stages. It monitors your production to record user sessions, extract flows, and generate tests. These tests can be run against any environment, pre-production, or production. You can therefore define multiple environments for an application.

You can manage application environments on the settings page.&#x20;
