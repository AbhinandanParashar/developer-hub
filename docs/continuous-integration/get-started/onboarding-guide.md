Welcome to the Harness CI onboarding guide. Discover how Harness accelerates software builds, enhances developer productivity, and streamlines CI processes with [intelligence features](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/harness-ci-intelligence), AI-driven insights, and hyper-optimized build infrastructure.

This guide will help you quickly get started with Harness CI, from setup to running your first build.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the walkthroughs in this guide, ensure you have:

- Access to a Harness account.
- Access to a source code repository.
- Have reviewed [CI overview](./overview.md) and [CI key concepts](./key-concepts.md).
- Have reviewed the [Harness Platform onboarding guide](/docs/platform/get-started/onboarding-guide) and [Harness Platform key concepts](/docs/platform/get-started/key-concepts).
- Have reviewed the [Harness CI migration guides](/docs/category/migrate-to-harness-ci) if you're migrating from another CI provider.

## Create your first Harness CI pipeline

Learn about [creating pipelines in Harness CI](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/prep-ci-pipeline-components.md) and then try it for yourself:

* [Tutorial - Build on Harness Cloud](./tutorials.md)
* [Tutorial - Build on a Kubernetes cluster](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/tutorial-ci-kubernetes-build-infra)

### Build infrastructure options

Harness offers several build infrastructure options, including Harness-managed and self-managed options. To compare build infrastructure options, go to [Which build infrastructure is right for me](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/which-build-infrastructure-is-right-for-me).

Harness recommends starting with [Harness Cloud build infrastructure](../use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/use-harness-cloud-build-infrastructure.md), which you can start using in minutes and is available for all plan tiers.

## Advance your pipelines

Explore the documentation to learn what your Harness CI pipelines can do.

* [Build images, push images, and upload artifacts.](../use-ci/build-and-upload-artifacts/build-and-upload-an-artifact)
* [Use caching](/docs/category/share-and-cache-ci-data) and [manage dependencies](/docs/category/manage-dependencies).
* Run [scripts](../use-ci/run-step-settings.md) and [tests](/docs/category/run-tests).
* [Use plugins](../use-ci/use-drone-plugins/explore-ci-plugins.md) and [write your own plugins](../use-ci/use-drone-plugins/custom_plugins.md).
