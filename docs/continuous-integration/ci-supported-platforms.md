Some Harness CI features are released behind feature flags to get feedback from a subset of customers before releasing the features to general availability.

You can opt-in to the early access (beta) features for Harness CI described in the following table. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable specific early access features in your Harness account. Include the feature flag or name with your request.
