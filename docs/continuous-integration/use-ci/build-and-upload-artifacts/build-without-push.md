Each organization may have different workflows to build and push Docker images. One common scenario is to build an image locally, scan it for vulnerabilities, and push only after a successful scan.

Harness CI now supports these workflows by passing environment variables to adjust the default behavior of the native **Build and Push steps**. Based on the selected build infrastructure Harness uses one of two build tools to build and push images- Kaniko or BuildX. You now have the option to pick one of these build tools.
Before we dive into the workflows supported by Harness, lets look at why you would choose one build tool over another.

**Kaniko** is used to build container images from a Dockerfile inside a container or Kubernetes pod.
- Runs without privileged mode (granting same capabilities as the host machine - making it a root-level container)
- **Default** choice for Kubernetes environments
- Executes Dockerfile instructions directly

**BuildX** is a Docker CLI plugin that extends Docker's build capabilities using BuildKit (Docker's builder). It relies on a Docker daemon to perform builds. 
- Better for caching and multi-platform builds
- **Default** choice for non kubernetes environments
- Works in two modes:
  - With Docker Daemon (may require Docker-in-Docker) 
  - Daemonless mode (using containerd or remote builders)

:::note
By default, Harness uses Kaniko for Kubernetes builds. To use BuildX instead, enable Docker Layer Caching (DLC) in your pipeline or enable the `CI_USE_BUILDX_ON_K8` feature flag by contacting [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io).

## Environment Variables Overview

This table summarizes the environment variables used across different **Build-only**, **Push-only**, **Build Once and Push to Many**, and **Build, Scan, and Push** workflows in **Harness CI**.

| **Environment Variable**     | **Description**                                                                                                                               | **Infrastructure (Cloud/Kubernetes)**  |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------|
| `PLUGIN_NO_PUSH`             | Skip pushing the image after it is built.                                                                                                     | Both                                   |
| `PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY`           | Push an image without rebuilding it.                                                                                                          | Both                                   |
| `PLUGIN_BUILDX_LOAD`         | Required when using a non default docker driver (docker-container, kubernetes or remote). The resulting image is loaded into local Docker image store to make it available in subsequent steps                                          | Both (BuildX only)                     |
| `PLUGIN_SOURCE_IMAGE`        | Specifies the name and tag of the image to retag and push.                                                                                    | Both                                   |
| `PLUGIN_TAR_PATH`            | Set the output path for the tarball image (if exporting as a `.tar` file).                                                                    | Both                                   |
| `PLUGIN_SOURCE_TAR_PATH`     | Path to the tarball image to be pushed.                                                                                                       | Both                                   |
| `PLUGIN_DAEMON_OFF`          | Runs BuildX in daemonless mode, commonly used for Kubernetes builds. Used in conjunction with a docker daemon provisioned in a Background step| Both (BuildX only)                     |

In the sections below, we will cover the following build and push image workflows: 
- Build-only
- Push-only
- Build once and push to multiple registries
- Build, scan and push image as a tarball using Kaniko

## Build-only
This mode builds a Docker image locally without pushing it to a registry. For instance, you might build an image locally and store it as an artifact or scan it for vulnerabilities in another step.

The examples above demonstrate build-only mode with the native Build and Push to Docker step. You can apply this to other registries using the appropriate native build and push steps in the Harness CI step palette with the same environment variables.

## Push-only
This mode pushes a pre-built Docker image without building it again. Ideally used after scanning or validation.

The examples above demonstrate push-only mode to Dockerhub on Harness Cloud. You can apply the same to other registries using the appropriate native build and push steps in the Harness CI step palette with the same environment variables.
When you build a traditional OCI image, the step uses properties like `tags`, `registry` and `repo` to properly push the image built.

## Build Once and Push to Multiple Registries in Parallel
This mode builds an image once and pushes it simultaneously to multiple registries(ECR, GAR, ACR and Docker) in parallel. Once an image is built, the native build and push steps expect a distinct tag for each of the images being pushed. Harness retags the image before pushing it to the registry.

### Setup
:::note
This workflow currently only works with **BuildX**.

Let us look at how this workflow is supported in Harness Cloud and Kubernetes

- Create separate push steps with:
  - `PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY`: `true` (Pushes without rebuilding)
  - `PLUGIN_SOURCE_IMAGE`: `Name of the image to retag before pushing` (Harness distinctly retags these images as required by the native step)

## Build, Scan, and Push (using Kaniko)

Following is a complete workflow to build, scan for vulnerabilities and then push the image. This example is using Kaniko, but the same can be achieved using BuildX

### Setup
- Build an image in a native **Build and Push** step with the following environment variables:
  - `PLUGIN_NO_PUSH`: `true` (skip pushing the image during build)
  - `PLUGIN_TAR_PATH`: `Path for saving the image` (e.g. /folder/image.tar)
- Push the image with the native **Build and Push** step with the following environment variables:
  - `PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY`: `true` (Pushes without rebuilding)
  - `PLUGIN_SOURCE_TAR_PATH`: `Path to your previously built image` (e.g. /folder/image.tar)

Refer to the following pipeline example:

```YAML
pipeline:
  projectIdentifier: PROJECT_ID
  orgIdentifier: ORG_ID
  identifier: build_scan_push
  name: build_scan_push
  stages:
    - stage:
        name: build_scan_push
        identifier: build_scan_push
        type: CI
        spec:
          cloneCodebase: true
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: BuildAndPushECR
                  name: Build Docker Image
                  identifier: BuildOnly
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: AWS_CONNECTOR
                    region: REGION
                    account: AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
                    imageName: test-image
                    tags:
                      - new-<+pipeline.sequenceId>
                    envVariables:
                      PLUGIN_NO_PUSH: "true"
                      PLUGIN_TAR_PATH: image.tar
              - step:
                  type: AquaTrivy
                  name: Scan with Aqua Trivy
                  identifier: AquaTrivy_1
                  spec:
                    mode: orchestration
                    config: default
                    target:
                      type: container
                      workspace: /harness/image.tar
                      detection: manual
                      name: test-image
                      variant: new-<+pipeline.sequenceId>
                    advanced:
                      log:
                        level: info
                    privileged: true
                    image:
                      type: local_archive
                contextType: Pipeline
              - step:
                  type: BuildAndPushECR
                  name: Push to ECR
                  identifier: push_only
                  spec:
                    connectorRef: AWS_CONNECTOR
                    region: REGION
                    account: AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
                    imageName: test-image
                    tags:
                      - new-<+pipeline.sequenceId>
                    envVariables:
                      PLUGIN_PUSH_ONLY: "true"
                      PLUGIN_SOURCE_TAR_PATH: image.tar
          infrastructure:
            type: KubernetesDirect
            spec:
              connectorRef: K8S_CONNECTOR_REF
              namespace: default
              automountServiceAccountToken: true
              nodeSelector: {}
              os: Linux
```

This approach separates building, scanning and pushing into distinct steps, improving security and pipeline flexibility.
