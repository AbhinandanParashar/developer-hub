By default, Harness uses anonymous access to connecto to the public [Harness GCR project](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/gcr-prod/global/harness) and [pull Harness images](/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/harness-ci.md). If you experience rate limiting issues when pulling images, use credentialed access, rather than anonymous access, to pull Harness CI images. For instructions, go to [Connect to the Harness container image registry with a Docker connector](/docs/platform/connectors/artifact-repositories/connect-to-harness-container-image-registry-using-docker-connector).
