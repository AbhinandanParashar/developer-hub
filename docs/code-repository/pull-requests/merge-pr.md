<!-- How to merge (CLI/GUI), merge strategies, merge requirements, status checks, branch protections -->

* Cant revert.
* Branch not auto-deleted unless rule enabled.
* Conflicts - Block merge but you must use other tools/CLI Git to inspect and resolve MCs.
* Rebase/update from main - Can create a PR to merge main into another branch or use CLI Git/other tools to rebase.
