:::

The [Harness Code Repository module](/docs/code-repository/code-supported.md) (Code) is a source code management (SCM) tool that fosters developer collaboration and accelerates innovation while keeping security and compliance in mind. Harness Code seamlessly integrates Git-based repositories across your software delivery processes in Harness.

The Harness Code supports these features:

* Create repositories
* Clone repositories
* Commits
* Tags
* Create pull requests
* Review pull requests and conduct code reviews
* Implement status checks
* Merge PRs, define merge requirements, and specify a merge strategy
* Use webhooks to trigger CI/CD pipelines

These features are in pre-beta or in development:

* Code owners
* Notifications
* Branch rules
* Repository import
* AIDA-powered semantic search
