:::note

Currently, the Code Repository module is in beta and behind a feature flag. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) if you're interested in this module.

:::

The [Harness Code Repository module](/docs/code-repository/code-supported.md) (Code) is a source code management (SCM) tool that fosters developer collaboration and accelerates innovation while keeping security and compliance in mind. Harness Code seamlessly integrates Git-based repositories across your software delivery processes in Harness.

The Harness Code supports these features:

* [Create repositories](./create-repos/create-repo.md)
* [Collaborate and develop](/docs/category/collaborate-and-develop): Create commits, branches, tags
   * Clone repositories to work remotely
   * Commit, branch, and tag directly in the Harness Platform
* Create, review, and merge [pull requests](/docs/category/pull-requests)
   * Conduct code reviews
   * Implement status checks
   * Define merge requirements
   * Specify merge strategies
* [Use webhooks to trigger CI/CD pipelines](./pipelines/webhooks.md)

These features are in pre-beta or in development:

* Code owners
* Notifications
* Branch rules
* Repository import
* AI-powered semantic search <!-- keyword search, add to AIDA section of platform docs -->

For information about what's supported for other Harness modules and the Harness Platform overall, go to [Supported platforms and technologies](/docs/get-started/supported-platforms-and-technologies.md).
