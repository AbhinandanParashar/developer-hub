:::warning

Archiving a repository will make it read-only and prevent any further changes to its content.

:::

To archive a repository in Harness Code:

1. In the Harness Code module, go to the Harness account, organization, or project that contains the repo you want to archive.

   This depends on where the repo was created or imported. For example, if it was created at the project scope, you need to navigate to the repo within that specific project.

2. Select **Repositories**.
3. Select the repository you want to archive.
4. Go to **Settings** and select **Archive*.
5. Follow the prompts to confirm deletion.
